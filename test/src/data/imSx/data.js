var data = {'WEIGHT LOSS': ' <H2> DEFINITION </H2>  A dog will lose weight when its energy use or  loss exceeds its energy intake and can, therefore, occur with increased use or loss, or with  decreased intake or absorption, or with both. A  loss of more than 10% of body weight is considered significant. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Reduced body condition • Cachexia denotes extreme weight loss  resulting from metabolic derangements  with associated weakness and depression,  and often cannot be corrected by increasing  dietary energy intake alone • Emaciation is severe weight loss and  equates to approximately > 20% loss of  body weight when bony prominences  become noticeable • Loss of muscle mass will occur in cachexia,  but loss in the absence of loss of fat suggests  inflammatory  myopathies  or  muscular  dystrophy • Other signs may be associated with the primary cause, e.g. diarrhoea in malabsorption, dyspnoea in  cardiac failure, pyrexia, etc. <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Normal to increased appetite, q.v.  section 1.36 Physiological • Exercise • Lactation • Planned weight loss programme • Pregnancy (weight gain later) Pathological • Malabsorption • ARD/SIBO • EPI • Mild IBD/CIE • Non- ketotic DM • Regurgitation,  q.v . section 1.41 • Vomiting,  q.v . section 1.49 Decreased appetite Any condition causing anorexia, q.v.  section 1.5 • Chronic kidney disease • Fever • Dysphagia and regurgitation: tries to eat but  cannot swallow,  q.v . section 1.41 • Heart failure (cardiac cachexia) • Hypoadrenocorticism • Ketoacidotic diabetes mellitus • Malabsorption • Severe CIE/IBD • Liver disease • Neoplasia (cancer cachexia) • Pain <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Normal to increased appetite • Chronic blood loss • Cold environment • Hyperthyroidism • Dietary: raw food containing thyroid  tissue • Iatrogenic • Rare functional tumour • Fanconi syndrome • Malabsorption • Bile salt malabsorption • Lymphangiectasia • Short bowel syndrome • Poor quality food • Protein- losing nephropathy • Systemic  fungal  infections,  especially  histoplasmosis • Temporal myositis • TMJ disease • Underfeeding • Accidental lack of food • Errors when calculating energy requirements • Malicious withholding of food • Widespread skin burns Decreased appetite • Malabsorption • Alimentary lymphoma • Oral disease • Oral neoplasia • Severe dental disease • TMJ dysplasia • Temporal muscle myositis • Severe intestinal parasitism • Severe pyoderma <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  1 Record weight, body condition score and  muscle score. 2 The differential diagnoses can be sub-  divided by whether the dog wants to eat or  has a reduced or absent appetite. 3 Weight loss simply due to lack of food intake  causes an expected weight loss of ~2% body  weight per week. 4 Weight loss in excess of 2% body weight per  week indicates increased energy loss or  usage. 5 Other signs may help localise the organ system involved and direct investigations.

Abnormal behaviour can be  observed as a spectrum of consciousness ( q.v .  section 1.4) ranging from reduced response to  even noxious stimuli to manic behaviour and  hyperactivity. Animals may also demonstrate  changes  in  sleep- wake  cycles,  social   relationships, repetitive activities, or spatial  disorientation. Behavioural disorders and medical disorders  causing behaviour change present a significant  challenge due to the considerable overlap in presentations. Behavioural disorders can be considered  after  medical disorders have been excluded  and are more common in younger animals presenting with increased reactivity or vigilance. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Aggression • Dullness and reduced responsiveness,  q.v .  section 1.4 • Excessive grooming • Hyperactivity (excessive pacing, circling,  altered sleep patterns) • Inappropriate elimination • Repetitive behaviours (fly catching, over-  grooming, tail chasing, flank sucking) <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Pain • Ear disease • Neuropathic • Orthopaedic Intracranial disorders • Cognitive dysfunction • Hydrocephalus • Idiopathic epilepsy • Inflammatory (meningoencephalitis of unknown  origin) • Neoplasia Metabolic disorders • Hepatic encephalopathy (portosystemic shunts,   chronic hepatitis, acute hepatic failure) • Hyperadrenocorticism • Hypertension • Hypothyroidism • Toxins Intestinal disorders • Idiopathic chronic inflammatory enteropathy  (CIE)/inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) • Neoplasia Urinary tract disorders • Atopy • Dermatological disorders • Ectopic ureters • Parasitic infection • Urinary tract infection • Urolithiasis <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Metabolic disorders • Hyperthyroidism • Phaeochromocytoma Intracranial disorders • Infectious disease, e.g.  Cryptococcus , distemper,  Toxoplasma ,  Neospora • Storage disease Dermatological disorders • Bacterial hypersensitivity Ocular disorders causing pain or impairing  vision • Cataracts • Progressive retinal atrophy • Uveitis <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Thorough screening for medical disorders  should be considered in young animals, or in  patients with acute onset change.

Diminished consciousness can be graded based  upon lack of responsiveness to increasingly  stimulatory external events. State of consciousness is an important component of the modified  Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS), useful prognostically and for monitoring purposes. Consciousness is primarily determined by the  ascending reticular activating system, an important set of neurons found within the brainstem.  Disorders of the brainstem can result in dysfunction of these neurons, with a consequent  reduced state of arousal of the individual.  Diffuse forebrain dysfunction (cerebral disorders) may also result in diminished consciousness in some circumstances ( q.v . modified  Glasgow Coma Scale in section 5.8). <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  Grades of dysfunction Depressed or obtunded • Reduced responsiveness to external visual or  auditory stimuli • Associated with brainstem, diffuse forebrain disorders, or systemic disease • Can have intermittent periods of more normal mentation Stuporous • Semi- comatose, responsive only to repeated  noxious stimuli • Typically associated with brainstem disorders, including brain herniation Comatose • Unresponsive to repeated noxious stimuli • Typically associated with brainstem disorders, including brain herniation Delirious • Hyperactive with excessive or abnormal  responses to external stimuli • Typically associated with forebrain disease <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Congenital • Hydrocephalus • PSS Inflammatory • Meningoencephalitis of unknown origin  (MUO) Infectious • Bacterial empyema, e.g. extension of otitis  media • Lungworm ( Angiostrongylus vasorum ) Iatrogenic • Head trauma • Toxins or drugs, e.g. sedation or anaesthesia,  hallucinogens Metabolic • Electrolyte disturbances, especially changes  in osmolarity due to too- rapid correction of  sodium disturbances • Hepatic encephalopathy • Hypoglycaemia • Severe systemic disease, e.g. sepsis, congestive  heart failure, etc. Neoplastic • Primary central nervous system (CNS)  tumours: meningioma, glioma, lymphoma Vascular • Thromboembolic or haemorrhagic stroke <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Congenital • Storage disease: signs may develop as dog  ages Infectious • Distemper • Protozoal:  Toxoplasma ,  Neospora • Rabies Iatrogenic • Complication of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  sampling in dogs with increased intracranial  pressure Vascular • Hyperviscosity,  e.g.  hyperglobulinaemia,  hyperlipidaemia, primary erythrocytosis <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Clinical clues Predisposition • Congenital disorders maybe suspected in  young dogs, especially those with conformational changes • Disproportionate stunting, e.g. congenital  hypothyroidism ( q.v . section 1.45) • Domed cranium ± open fontanelle in  hydrocephalus • Small stature in PSS • Small purebred middle- aged dogs are predisposed to meningoencephalitis of unknown  origin (e.g. Maltese terrier, Pug, West  Highland White terrier [WHWT]) History • Anti- parasitic prophylaxis may indicate lesser  risk of  Angiostrongylus  infection • Lifestyle may increase index of suspicion for  infectious disease, e.g. raw- fed may increase  suspicion of toxoplasmosis or exposure to  toxins or risk of trauma Clinical examination Visual inspection • Interaction with the environment, increasing  external stimuli (to include visual and auditory tests) Physical examination • Assess for signs of systemic disease in cases of  obtundation; mentation changes may be secondary to this, or, in multisystemic disease,  may detect abnormalities on examination • Heart rate and blood pressure (BP): a patient  with bradycardia (pulse rate < 60 beats/minute) and hypertension (systolic BP >  160 mmHg) is at risk of increased intracranial pressure (Cushing’s reflex) Neurological examination • Cranial nerve assessment is particularly  important in stuporous and comatose animals given the high suspicion of a brainstem  disorder • Focus on assessment of forebrain (mentation,  proprioception,  menace  response  and  response to nasal stimulation) and brainstem  (proprioception  and  cranial  nerves)  functions • MUO typically presents with a multifocal  lesion localisation, whereas metabolic disease  typically results in symmetrical deficits localising to the forebrain Ophthalmic examination • Papilloedema (optic disc swelling) is suggestive of increased intracranial pressure Laboratory findings Haematology • Assess for signs of severe systemic disease  (e.g. marked leukocyte changes supportive of  an inflammatory focus) • Increased PCV in primary erythrocytosis  (typically > 68%) • May reveal microcytosis ± hypochromasia  in PSS Serum biochemistry • Evidence of hepatic dysfunction (low albumin, cholesterol, urea, glucose, increased  ammonia) and increased bile acids • Increased liver enzyme activities are not typical in PSS but are detected in other  hepatopathies • Hypoglycaemia • Sodium concentrations: review previous  results in hospitalised animals to assess for  changes in sodium indicating too- rapid correction of marked hypernatraemia Imaging NB: Cross- sectional imaging (MRI) is often  indicated for primary CNS diseases Plain radiographs • Screening in cases with a high suspicion of  multisystemic disorders (e.g. assessing for  neoplasia) • Skull radiographs may be useful in cases of  head trauma, but rarely in hydrocephalus Ultrasound • Assess for liver size and echotexture when suspicious of hepatic dysfunction.

IRIS guidelines  for acute kidney injury (AKI) define this in the  context of fluid volume responsiveness over a  6- hour period; with anuria defined as no urine  produced and oliguria < 1  ml/kg/hour after  intravenous fluid therapy to correct dehydration and hypovolaemia. These definitions are  useful as part of decision making on whether  renal replacement therapy is required. Failure to produce normal volumes of urine  may also occur due to pre- renal causes (e.g.  severe dehydration) and post- renal causes (e.g.  bilateral ureteric obstruction, urethral obstruction, ruptured bladder). These are important  exclusions before determining a renal cause for  lack of urine production. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Anuria is normally not the primary concern  on presentation in patients; typically systemic  causes of lack of glomerular filtration are the  primary signs, including vomiting, anorexia,  lethargy, or collapse related to potassium or  central nervous system disturbances. • Failure to produce urine due to post- renal  causes is most commonly accompanied by  stranguria and dysuria ( q.v . section  1.19)  except for ureteric causes, where abdominal  pain and signs related to anuria may be the  primary sign. <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Infectious causes • Leptospirosis • Pyelonephritis Toxins • Ethylene glycol • Grapes and raisins Drugs • NSAIDs Vascular • Severe hypotension or renal ischaemia, e.g.  sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction, severe cardiac failure Miscellaneous • Cutaneous and renal glomerulovasculopathy  (CRGV, ‘Alabama rot’) • Hypercalcaemia <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Infectious •  Babesia •  Leishmania Vascular • Renal infarction Miscellaneous • Hyperviscosity, e.g. primary erythrocytosis,  hyperglobulinaemia • Myoglobinuria or haemoglobinuria Drugs • Radiographic contrast agents • ACE inhibitors Neoplasia • Renal lymphoma likely bilateral if causing  reduced glomerular filtration rate <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  1 Anuria or oliguria is usually detected in  patients following identification of azotaemia on blood tests, or in systemically unwell  patients where urine output is being  monitored. 2 Exclude pre- renal causes by assessing hydration status, urinary specific gravity (if urine  is available), and measuring urinary bladder  size and body weight. 3 Response to intravenous fluid therapy (aim  to correct hydration over a 12- hour period)  can be monitored. Even with severe dehydration anuria is not anticipated. 4 Assess for post- renal causes by establishing history, passing a urinary catheter and  renal imaging to assess bilateral ureteric  obstruction  (uncommon  in  dogs).  Placement of a urinary catheter is also  useful to enable ongoing urinary output  monitoring. 5 Response to furosemide (furosemide stress  test) following rehydration can be utilised to  determine if functional renal tissue is intact.  If the patient does not produce urine in spite  of furosemide administration, prognosis for  renal recovery without renal replacement  therapy is considered guarded.

Bleeding diathesis means a tendency to bleed or bruise easily. Haematoma is red or discoloured skin that  does not blanch under pressure and occurs due  to the presence of blood under the skin. These  lesions can be defined by size; petechiae refers  to haematomas < 3 mm and ecchymosis refers  to haematomas > 1  cm.

Borborygmi are rumbling/gurgling  sounds caused by GI contractions mixing and  moving fluid and gas. Some gas production in the GI tract is a normal physiological process, but excess produc- tion can be the result of GI disease or ingestion  of non- absorbable fermentable substances. • The gas may be: • Caused by bacterial fermentation • Gas diffusing from the blood • Swallowed air • The product of luminal chemical reactions  (acid- alkali reactions) • The presence of flatulence can be detected by  finding  abdominal  distension  or  by  auscultation • Whilst eructation is the release of accumulated gas via the mouth, flatus is the release of  gases via the anus. These are often odiferous  because they contain volatile molecules such  as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, indoles, skatoles, volatile amines and short- chain fatty  acids produced by bacterial metabolism. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Abdominal discomfort • Audible borborygmi • Bloating • Eructation (belching) • Flatus <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Aerophagia • Dysphagia,  q.v . section 1.17 • Dyspnoea,  especially  in  BOAS,  q.v .  section 1.18 • Rapid/competitive eating Diseases causing malabsorption  and alterations in microbiome • CIE/IBD • Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency • Intestinal dysbiosis/antibiotic- responsive diarrhoea/small intestinal bacterial overgrowth Ingestion of non- absorbable substances • Fermentable carbohydrates such as stachyose  and raffinose found in soya and fermentable  fibres <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Administration of calcium carbonate to neutralise gastric acid or to treat hypocalcaemia,  releasing carbon dioxide • Diffusion of gas from the bloodstream • Unimportant in dogs except in GDV • Extreme exercise, causing aerophagia • Ileus causing stasis of gut contents and secondary bacterial fermentation • Ingestion of carbonated drinks • Lactase deficiency: theoretical but never documented in dogs • Lactulose <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  1 Obtain a full dietary history. 2 Auscultate and image chest if the dog is  dyspnoeic. 3 Palpate and image the abdomen. 4 Investigate underlying causes of GI disease. Clinical clues The presence of audible borborygmi can be  normal, especially in unfed dogs, with the  sound mainly originating from gastric motility.  As an isolated finding in an otherwise asymptomatic dog, increased borborygmi are not a concern. Excessive borborygmi in conjunction with  flatus is abnormal, but the pattern of gut sounds  is not pathognomonic for any specific disease.

Discolouration of urine can be caused  by the presence of intact RBCs or free haemoglobin  and  other  pigments  including  myoglobin. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Haematuria or any change in urine colour  may be the only clinical sign in some dogs. • It may be in combination with signs of dysuria,  q.v . section 1.19 • There may be concurrent evidence of systemic disease or bleeding diathesis. Some  dogs with significant haemorrhage may even  pass blood clots during their urine stream. As  with any cause of bleeding, causes can be  divided into disorders of the urinary tract or  related to a disorder of haemostasis (systemic  disease). • Haematuria can be discriminated from haemoglobinuria (both will cause reddened  urine) by sediment examination after allowing the urine to sediment, ideally, after centrifugation. Red blood cells will form a pellet  whereas with haemoglobinuria the urine will  remain tinged red with no pellet. A fresh sample should be examined as RBCs will lyse  spontaneously in stored urine samples. <H2> COMMON CAUSES – HAEMATURIA </H2>  Urinary tract disease • Renal haemorrhage • Pyelonephritis • Trauma •

occurrence of haematuria may prioritise differential diagnoses but  this must be interpreted in combination with  other investigations • Haematuria at the beginning of the urinary  stream implies genital tract or urethral  disorders • Haematuria throughout the duration of the  urinary stream occurs with many disorders  (renal, ureteral, bladder, or systemic disorders, occasionally urethral and prostatic  disorders can also result in reflux of blood  into the bladder) • Haematuria during the terminal phase suggests a ventral bladder wall lesion and can  also occur with intermittent renal haemorrhage (as the blood is pooled in the ventral  bladder and expelled at the end) • Haemorrhage occurring independent of  urination implies a disorder of the distal  urethra or genital tract

This  results in transient, typically short episodes  with convulsions or focal motor, autonomic or  behavioural features and is due to abnormal  excessive and/or synchronous epileptic neuronal activity in the brain. Seizures can be focal or generalised in nature. • Focal seizures are less common and present  with lateralised or regional signs, e.g. facial  twitching, hypersalivation, or behavioural  change • Generalised seizures are characterised by  bilateral involvement and typically result in  tonic- clonic movements, loss of consciousness, and often have autonomic signs, i.e. urination, defaecation, salivation <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  Epileptic seizures can have up to three phases;  prodrome, ictal, and post- ictal stages. 1 The prodrome is not commonly observed in  dogs and is detected as disrupted behavior  predictive of a seizure. 2 The ictal stage is the seizure itself. 3 The post- ictal period occurs after the seizure  and may last hours to days; during this time  the dog may be disorientated and display  abnormal behaviour such as aggression,  compulsive walking, excessive drinking, eating, or vocalisation. <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Extracranial causes • Hypoglycaemia • Hepatic encephalopathy: PSS, chronic  hepatitis • Hypoadrenocorticism • Insulinoma • Sepsis • Toxins, e.g. ivermectin, xylitol • Young toy- breed dogs Intracranial causes • Idiopathic • Inflammatory: meningoencephalitis of  unknown origin • Neoplasia: meningioma, glioma • Congenital: hydrocephalus <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Extracranial causes • Electrolyte disturbances • Hypocalcaemia • Sodium derangements • Hyperviscosity • Erythrocytosis • Hyperglobulinaemia • Hypertensive encephalopathy • Large/diffuse neoplasia • Uraemia Intracranial causes • Degenerative, e.g. storage disease • Infectious •  Angiostrongylus vasorum • Bacterial empyema • Distemper • Fungal disease •  Toxoplasma  and  Neospora • Neoplasia • CNS lymphoma • Metastatic neoplasia • Vascular: haemorrhagic or thromboembolic  stroke <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Clinical clues Predisposition • Idiopathic epilepsy is the most common  intracranial cause of seizures in dogs aged  1–5 years • Border collies and GSDs are predisposed to  idiopathic epilepsy • Middle- aged small-  and toy- breed dogs are  predisposed  to  meningoencephalitis  of  unknown origin History • Behaviour between seizures is important;  dogs with idiopathic epilepsy would be  expected to be normal after recovery from the  post- ictal stage • Duration and progression of neurological  signs may aid in index of suspicion • Acute onset improving increases suspicion  of vascular or toxin • Gradual onset progression may increase  suspicion of degenerative or neoplastic  disease • Thorough history is important to discriminate between seizures, syncope, and movement disorders • Movement disorders may cause abnormal  movements in all four limbs, but consciousness tends to be preserved • Syncope occurs more commonly during  exercise or excitement and is normally  characterised by brief, flaccid collapse with  no post- ictal period Clinical examination Visual inspection • Mentation may be impaired, additional signs of  forebrain disease may be circling, head pressing,  blindness and abnormal responsiveness Physical examination • Bradycardia and hypertension (Cushing’s  reflex) may be detected in dogs with increased  intracranial pressure • Thorough examination to assess for multisystemic disease Neurological examination • A full neurological examination should be  performed • Normal between seizures if idiopathic  epilepsy • Multifocal abnormalities are most suspicious for inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic disease • The forebrain can be assessed with the menace response, proprioception, response to  nasal stimulation, and observing mentation Ophthalmic examination • May be useful to assess for infiltrative central  nervous system disease, e.g. may detect  papilloedema Laboratory findings Haematology • Uncommon to detect changes Serum biochemistry • Blood glucose to assess for hypoglycaemia as  a cause (ideally close temporally to seizure) • Electrolytes in particular calcium and sodium • Evidence of hepatic dysfunction (low urea,  albumin, cholesterol, glucose, increased bile  acid stimulation test results and ammonia) or  hepatic injury (increased enzyme activities) Imaging Plain radiographs • Screen for disseminated neoplasia in cases  with a high suspicion Ultrasound • Screen for disseminated neoplasia in cases  with a high suspicion • Assess for PSS;

Reverse sneezing is forceful inspiration via  the nose against a closed glottis, often occurring  in paroxysms. The differential diagnoses for sneezing and  reverse sneezing are mostly shared, with the difference related to the location of the disorder,  i.e. more caudal nasal disorders are more likely  to present with reverse sneezing, but with a few  exceptions noted below. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  Sneezing is fairly simple for owners to recognise  as it is very similar to sneezing in people.  Reverse sneezing can be more distressing and  harder to characterise, and can be mistaken for  breathing difficulties by inexperienced owners. • Concurrent nasal discharge: serous, mucopurulent, haemorrhagic or a mixture • Coughing due to post- nasal drip and aspiration of nasal discharge • Nasal depigmentation/deformities • Pawing at face • Stertor or snoring due to reduced nasal  airflow <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Chronic idiopathic rhinitis • Infection • Sino- nasal aspergillosis • Tooth root abscess • Elongated  soft  palate  causing  reverse  sneezing • FB • Neoplasia: carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Infection • Oronasal fistula • Osteomyelitis • Parasitic  ( Linguatula  serrata ,  Pneumonyssoides caninum ) • Neoplasia (leiomyoma) • Cleft palate • Reverse sneezing may occur due to lower airway disease with irritation of the nasopharynx  due to coughed- up secretions and with reflux <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Clinical clues Predisposition • Breed predisposition in sino- nasal aspergillosis suspected in Golden retrievers • Dolichocephalic dogs are predisposed to  sino- nasal aspergillosis • Older dogs are predisposed to nasal tumours  and dental disease • Reverse sneezing may occur in dogs with  elongated soft palates, e.g. brachycephalic  dogs, CKCS Physical examination • Assess nasal airflow • Tissue or cotton wool to detect airflow at  each nostril • Microscope  slide  and  assess  for  condensation • Stethoscope and auscultate each side • Examination of head conformation including  ocular retropulsion for signs of deformity  suspicious for neoplasia • Examination of nasal planum for depigmentation (most common in fungal disease) • Oral examination to assess for dental disease  and oronasal fistulas Laboratory findings Haematology and serum biochemistry • Often unremarkable, but useful to screen for  systemic disease Imaging Plain radiographs • Nasal turbinate destruction: tumour or  aspergillosis • Soft tissue opacity: tumour is most likely but  can also occur with fluid accumulation • Sinus hyperostosis ( Aspergillus ) Special tests •  Aspergillus  serology: specific but poorly sensitive test, i.e. a positive result supports infection but a negative result does not exclude it • CT scan with contrast to assess for nasal  diseases • Culture of nasal discharge is not useful; likely  bacterial flora and positive  Aspergillus  culture is not diagnostic as it can be an environmental contaminant • Nasal cytology (rarely useful) and tissue sample for histopathology • Rhinoscopy to assess for nasal FB, tumours,  or aspergillosis', 'STIFFNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND GENERALISED LAMENESS': ' <H2> DEFINITIONS </H2>  • Stiffness is a reduction in the range of joint  movement and overall mobility. • A joint swelling is enlargement of a synovial  joint due to accumulation of fluid or soft tissue inflammation. • Lameness is an abnormal gait resulting from  partial loss of function or pain in a limb usually due to an orthopaedic problem. • Generalised lameness affects two or more  limbs and typically is related to systemic  disease. • Shifting lameness is when limbs are affected  sequentially. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  Stiffness, joint swelling, and generalised lameness may be identified together or in isolation. • Abnormal or short- strided gait • Change in mobility, e.g. reluctance to exercise, jump up/down onto furniture or climb/ descend stairs • Change in posture • Joint swelling • Tachycardia and tachypnoea may occur in  the acute phase • Weight shifting when standing • Yelping or crying out, and sensitivity to touch  due to pain <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Spinal pain • IVDD • Steroid  responsive  meningitis  arteritis  (SRMA) Musculoskeletal pain • Cellulitis • Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis) • FB • Fracture • Immune- mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) • Neoplasia: osteosarcoma • Trauma <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Spinal pain • Discospondylitis • Nerve root tumour and other neoplasms of  the spine Musculoskeletal pain • Aortic thromboembolism • Metaphyseal osteopathy • Myositis • Osteomyelitis • Panosteitis • Septic joint <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Clinical clues Predisposition • Breed predisposition • IVDD: Bassets, Dachshunds and, to a lesser  extent, many other breeds, e.g. Cocker  spaniel, Pekingese, Poodle • Metaphyseal osteopathy: Weimaraner • Osteosarcoma: large and giant breeds • SRMA: Beagle, Boxer, Whippet • Juvenile dogs: SRMA, metaphyseal osteopathy and panosteitis • Older dogs: neoplasia and degenerative joint  disease History • Dogs with generalised lameness, in particular  with inflammatory causes (IMPA), may present with signs of lethargy only; specific questions around normal behaviours may uncover  more subtle signs of joint pain • Lameness in multiple limbs is more difficult  to detect than lameness in a single limb • Spinal pain and abdominal pain can be difficult to discriminate; GI signs will aid this, i.e.  in the absence of vomiting or diarrhoea, spinal pain would be considered more likely  than abdominal pain • Stiffness and significant lameness can be  detected by owners, but joint swelling is not  normally detected by owners Clinical examination Visual inspection • Assess demeanour, ambulation, and navigating specific obstacles (e.g. stairs), and in some  cases video recordings of the dog during episodes can be very useful • Disorders involving multiple limbs can be  more challenging than those affecting single  limbs due to more subtle signs of lameness Physical examination During thorough examination pain may be  localised; in some cases it may be important to  pay attention for subtle signs of discomfort, e.g.  lip licking • Crepitus in degenerative joint disease • Joint swelling and reduced range of movement • Pyrexia is typically observed in steroid  responsive meningitis arteritis, IMPA and  metaphyseal osteopathy Orthopaedic and neurological examinations • To identify sites of pain and distinguish musculoskeletal causes of abnormal gait pain  from neurological causes Laboratory findings Haematology and serum biochemistry • Useful to screen for systemic inflammatory  disease Imaging • Plain radiographs and abdominal ultrasound  may be useful once pain is localised Special tests • Analgesia trial in the absence of suspicion of  severe systemic disease • Arthrocentesis cytology and culture for IMPA  or septic joint • C- reactive protein (CRP) may be increased in  dogs with inflammatory disorders (SRMA,  septic joint, IMPA) • CSF cytology for SRMA • Infectious disease screening in particular in  travelled  dogs:  Anaplasma ,  Ehrlichia ,  Leishmania , and  Borrelia • Spec cPL can be increased in IVDD as well as  pancreatitis, therefore may not aid in  discriminating', 'STUNTING': ' <H2> DEFINITION </H2>  Stunting (retarded growth) is a reduced rate of  growth resulting in a dog failing to attain the  expected size, weight and/or height standards  characteristic of a dog of the same age and  breed. <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Proportionately small size or disproportionate stunting, i.e. normal body length but short  limbs • Signs of relevant organ dysfunction • Exercise intolerance • Neurological signs • Polyphagia • PU/PD • Vomiting and/or diarrhoea <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Congenital cardiac disease • Chondrodystrophy • Hepatic dysfunction • Congenital PSS • Inadequate diet: • Underfeeding • Poor- quality food • Malabsorption • Antibiotic- responsive diarrhoea (ARD or  dysbiosis) • EPI • Food- responsive enteropathy • Parasitism:  Giardia , hookworms • Renal dysplasia <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Achondroplasia and chondrodysplasia • Congenital hypothyroidism • Diabetes mellitus • Endocarditis • Food allergy • Hepatic dysfunction • Glycogen storage disease • Lobular dissecting hepatitis • Portal vein hypoplasia: non- cirrhotic portal  hypertension • Hydrocephalus • Hypoadrenocorticism • Malabsorption • Chronic intussusception • CIE/IBD • Oesophageal disease • Congenital megaoesophagus • Vascular ring anomaly • Pituitary dwarfism • Vitamin and mineral deficiencies • Vitamin A • Vitamin D • Vitamin B 12 • Imerslund- Gräsbeck syndrome (selective  cobalamin malabsorption) • Vegan diet • Zinc deficiency <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  • Determine appetite • Anorexia suggestive of metabolic disease • Polyphagia suggestive of malabsorption or  EPI • Use other clinical signs to identify potential  organ systems • Serum biochemistry to identify metabolic  causes • Investigate specific organ systems Clinical clues Some breeds, such as Yorkshire terriers and  poodles, have a range of normal sizes, but  stunting can be recognised by comparison with  unaffected littermates. • Alopecia in pituitary dwarfism • Chondrodystrophy is part of the normal  breed standard in certain, short- legged  breeds, and can cause type 1 IVDD • Mental retardation can occur in untreated  congenital hypothyroidism • Disproportionate stunting is suggestive of chondrodysplasia or congenital hypothyroidism • Dyspnoea/tachypnoea in inhalation pneumonia • Intermittent forebrain signs due to hepatic  encephalopathy or hydrocephalus • Fibrous osteodystrophy (rubber jaw) in renal  dysplasia Predisposition • ARD and EPI in GSDs • Chondrodystrophy can be normal in several  short- legged breeds: Dachshunds, Bassets • Hydrocephalus in miniature and toy breeds:  Chihuahua, Papillon, Yorkshire terrier • Hydrocephalus in brachycephalics;

This must be discriminated from nocturia (urinating overnight) or  inappropriate urination (e.g. behavioural or  during excitement or apprehension). Urinary incontinence may occur due to a  failure to store urine (storage disorders), or due  to an inability to completely void the bladder  during conscious urination and resultant urinary leaking (overflow incontinence). Urinary incontinence may present as constant leaking, or occurrence may be related to  specific circumstances (lying down, or during  activity). <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Neurological disease depending on the cause • Systemic illness • Urinary tract infection: haematuria, pollakiuria, pungent urine <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  Storage disorders • Detrusor  hyperreflexia/instability  (urge  incontinence) • Calculi • Infection: urethritis • Neoplasia • Polyps • Ectopic ureter • Urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence  (USMI) • Urinary tract infection Overflow incontinence • Partial obstruction • Neoplasia • Prostatic disease (abscess, paraprostatic  cyst,  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia,  neoplasia) • Urethritis • Urolithiasis • Neurogenic  (brainstem  or  spinal  cord  disorders) <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  Storage disorders • Persistent urachus • Ureterocoele • Urethrovaginal or urethrorectal fistula Overflow incontinence • Detrusor atony • Detrusor urethral dyssynergy • Dysautonomia <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  Clinical clues Predisposition • Neuter status influences risk of prostatic  disorders • Neutered dogs are most likely to have  carcinoma • Entire dogs are most likely to have benign  prostatic hyperplasia, abscess, or paraprostatic cysts • USMI can be detected in any dog, however  most common in female neutered dogs • Young dogs, in particular Golden retrievers,  increase suspicion of ectopic ureter History • Assess for polyuria and polydipsia • Concurrent dyschezia increases suspicion of  intrapelvic mass lesion (enlarged prostate or  lymph nodes) • In dogs with bacterial cystitis an emphasis  should be placed on establishing risk factors  that may have predisposed to the development of infection: • Anatomical causes (juvenile vaginitis in  puppies, hooded vulva in female dogs, urinary incontinence (e.g. ectopic ureter,  USMI) • Presence of systemic disease (hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus) • Immunosuppression • Urination in inappropriate places whilst the  dog is conscious and aware is likely behavioural unless there is a UTI or severe PU/PD Clinical examination Visual inspection • Measuring bladder size (using ultrasonography) following voiding may help establish  whether the dog is able to void their bladder  (if this remains large, obstructive and neurological causes are more likely) • Urination pattern • Dogs with reflex dyssynergia or urethral  obstruction typically try to initiate urination as normal;

Obesity is an abnormal accumulation of body  fat and develops when caloric intake is increased  and/or energy use is decreased. • Any increase > 15% over ideal body weight is  considered overweight • Obesity is usually defined as an increase in  body fat such that body weight is 20%  greater than ideal • Obesity predisposes to significant health risks • Cardiovascular disease • Diabetes mellitus • Orthopaedic disease: cruciate ligament disease, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis, IVDD <H2> RELATED CLINICAL SIGNS </H2>  • Increased appetite • Increased body mass • Ascites • Increased fat deposition • Large mass • Lethargy/exercise intolerance <H2> COMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Decreased exercise • Inactive lifestyle • Limited by orthopaedic (especially osteoarthritis) or cardiorespiratory disease (especially BOAS) • Dietary • High- calorie diets • Overeating/overfeeding • Drugs • Corticosteroids • Phenobarbital • Progestagens • Genetic predisposition: pro- opiomelanocortin  (POMC) mutation • Hepatosplenomegaly • HAC • Hypogonadism, especially in bitches after  ovariohysterectomy • Hypothyroidism • Pregnancy <H2> UNCOMMON CAUSES </H2>  • Acromegaly • Increased abdominal organ size • Insulinoma • Large mass (e.g. lipoma, haemangiopericytoma, granulosa cell tumour) • Peripheral oedema/ascites • Pyometra <H2> DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH </H2>  1 Record weight and body condition score. 2 If an increase in body weight is noted which  cannot be reduced by decreasing dietary  intake or if there are concurrent clinical  signs, a pathological cause should be sought. 3 If overfeeding can be ruled out, and there is  no obvious fluid accumulation or mass, an  endocrinopathy is most likely.
