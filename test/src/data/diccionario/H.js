Venous blood is darker because it is only about 20% \u2013 70% saturated, depending on how much oxygen is being used by the tissues. The affinity of hemoglobin  for carbon monoxide is 210 times as strong as its affinity for oxygen. The  complex formed ( carboxyhemoglobin ) cannot transport oxygen. Thus, carbon monoxide poisoning results in hypoxia and asphyxiation. Another form of hemoglobin that cannot transport oxygen is methemoglobin , in which the iron atom is oxidized to the +3 oxidation state. During the life span of a red cell, hemoglobin is slowly oxidized to methemoglobin. At least four different enzyme systems can convert methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. When these are defective or overloaded, methemoglobinemia, in which high methemoglobin concentrations cause dyspnea and cyanosis, may result. As red cells wear out or are damaged, they are ingested by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.

Called also water on the brain. Although hydrocephalus occurs occasionally in adults, it is usually associated with a congenital defect in offspring. There are two types of hydrocephalus, the distinction being based on whether there is abnormal absorption of the cerebrospinal fluid or an obstruction to its  flow. In  communicating hydrocephalus there is some abnormality in the capacity to absorb fluid from the arachnoid space. There is no obstruction to the  flow  of fluid between the ventricles. In  noncommunicating hydrocephalus , there is an obstruction at some point in the ventricular system. The cause of noncommunicating hydrocephalus usually is a congenital abnormality, such as stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius (the mesencephalic aqueduct), or congenital atresia of the lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle. Infections, intraventricular hemorrhage, trauma, and tumors can produce acquired noncommunicating hydrocephalus. There are three forms that occur in cattle: in one there is gross distention of the cranium with normal facial bones; in the second, there is a similar enlargement of the cranium with an accompanying achondroplastic dishing of the face and foreshortening of the maxilla and a shortening of the limb bones \u2014 these are the classical \u2018 bulldog \u2019 calves; in the third, the cranium is normal in size, but there is internal hydrocephalus and the calves are blind and imbecile. There are a number of inherited hydrocephalitides in cattle. The disease also occurs in pigs, but the inheritance is complex in that it is exacerbated by a concurrent hypovitaminosis A. In dogs and cats, hydrocephalus is common in some toy breeds such as the Chihuahua in which a domed cranium is a desirable feature of conformation.

Antigen  binding causes the cell to release vasoactive factors. The basis for anaphylaxis and atopy. Type II causes cell destruction (cytotoxicity) by the action of immunoglobulin with complement or cytotoxic cells. Seen in red blood cell transfusion reactions and in alloimmune hemolytic anemia. See also antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Type III (called also immune-complex or subacute hypersensitivity) tissue damage and inflammation are induced by the deposition of antigen  \u2013 antibody complexes that activate complement and attract polymorphonuclear cells. Type IV (called also delayed hypersensitivity) involves sensitized T lymphocytes that react with cell bound or associated antigen and release lymphokines, causing mononuclear cell accumulation, tissue damage, and inflammation, typically manifesting at least 24 hours after exposure  to the antigen. 2. a state of increased responsivity to physical stimuli.", "@r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@ angiitis": "variant of polyarteritis nodosa; a disease of small blood vessels in humans; called also leukocytoclastic vasculitis.", "antibody-mediated @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "types I, II, and III hypersensitivity reactions.", "bacterial @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "immune responses to bacteria or bacterial products may contribute to the clinical features of some diseases, e.g., the anemia associated with salmonellosis, arthritis in erysipelas of pigs, intestinal lesions in Johne \u2019 s disease, or be the principal cause as in staphylococcal hypersensitivity dermatitis in dogs.", "contact @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "a type IV reaction produced by contact of the skin with a lowmolecular-weight chemical substance having the properties of a hapten in a sensitized individual; it includes allergic contact dermatitis.", "cutaneous basophil @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "a delayed inflammatory response characterized by  large numbers of basophils.", "cytotoxic @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "type II hypersensitivity.", "delayed @r:@h.|hypersensitivity@:r@": "type IV reaction.

It includes the optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and hypophysis (pituitary gland), but for physiological purposes, the hypophysis is considered a distinct structure. The hypothalamic nuclei activate, control, and integrate many of the involuntary functions necessary for living. The various hypothalamic centers influence  peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, thirst, and hunger, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. Because of its influence on the release and inhibition of pituitary  hormones, the hypothalamus indirectly plays an important role in the regulation of protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, body fluid  volume and electrolyte content, and internal secretion of endocrine hormones. The hormones synthesized and secreted by the special neurons of the hypothalamus are called hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones or factors . They act directly on the tissues of the pituitary gland. Some of the major hypothalamic factors are: thyroid-stimulating hormone releasing hormone (TRH), which activates the release of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland; corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF); growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF); gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH); and prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF). In addition, there are other stimulating and inhibiting factors that influence the release and retention of other  anterior pituitary hormones. The hypothalamic hormones or factors are secreted directly into the veins in the lower part of the hypothalamus and are transported directly to the tissues of the pituitary gland. This transportation network is called the hypothalamic \u2013 hypophysial portal system.
