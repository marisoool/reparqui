The ear is made up of the outer (external) ear, the middle ear, and the inner (internal) ear. The anatomical parts of all three can be found under their specific names.  See also auricular , auditory , external ear . The outer ear consists of the auricle, or pinna, and the external acoustic meatus. The auricle collects sound waves and directs them to the external acoustic meatus, which conducts them to the tympanum. The tympanic membrane (eardrum) separates the outer ear from the middle ear. The middle ear contains three ossicles, the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup), so called because of their resemblance to these objects. These three small bones form a chain across the middle ear from the tympanum to the oval window of the inner ear. The middle ear is connected to the nasopharynx by the auditory tube, through which the air pressure on the inner side of the eardrum is equalized with the air pressure on its outside surface. Two muscles attached to the ossicles contract when loud noises strike the tympanic membrane (the stapedius and tensor tympani) that limit its vibration and thus protect it and the inner ear from damage. The inner ear contains a bony labyrinth that supports a membranous labyrinth made up of the cochlea, semicircular canals, utriculus, and sacculus. When a sound strikes the ear, it causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate. The ossicles function as levers, gearing down the motion of the tympanic membrane so that its impedance of a membrane vibrating in air, matches the impedance of vibration in the fluid occurring in the inner  ear, and passing the vibrations on to the cochlea. From there the vestibulocochlear (eighth cranial) nerve transmits the vibrations, translated into nerve impulses, to the auditory center in the brain. See also hearing . The semicircular canals, utriculus, and sacculus provide essential information for the sense of balance.

To protect the eye the bones of the skull are shaped so that an orbital cavity protects most aspects of each globe. Anteriorly, the conjunctival sac covers the space between the orbital rim and the eye and lines the upper and lower eyelids. Tears from the lacrimal glands are constantly secreted over the ocular surface to maintain hydration, lubricate and remove foreign objects from the corneal and conjunctival surfaces. The eye is also protected by the eyelids with their sensitive eyelashes. The eye has three coats: the outer fibrous tunic, composed of the cornea  (the clear transparent layer on the front of the eye) and the sclera (the white of the eye). Together, this tough outer coat helps protect the delicate mechanisms of the eye. The middle vascular (or uveal) layer is composed of the choroid posteriorly and the iris and ciliary body anteriorly. The innermost neurosensory layer comprises the retina with its specialized light-sensitive rods and cones and present only in the posterior aspect of the globe. Behind the cornea and in front of the lens is the iris, the circular pigmented band around the pupil. The iris works much like the diaphragm in a camera, widening or narrowing the pupil to adjust to different light conditions. Nerve fibers from the  retina leave the back of the eye as the optic nerve and transmit nerve impulses to the occipital cortex of the brain where they are interpreted as vision.", "almond-shaped @r:@e.|eye@:r@": "observed with dehydration in birds, where the eye is sunken, particularly in raptors that normally have a prominent, round globe.
