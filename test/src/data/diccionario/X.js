X-rays are produced by the collision of a beam of electrons with a metal target in an x-ray tube. Called also roentgen rays. The penetrability and hardness of the x-rays increases with the voltage applied to the x-ray tube, which controls the speed with which the electrons strike the target. For diagnostic radiography, tube voltages in the range 50 \u2013 120 kilovolts peak (kVp) are normally used. For radiation therapy, voltages in the 1- to 2-megavolt range are used for most treatment. Accelerating electrons to speeds high enough to produce megavoltage x-rays requires a linear accelerator (lineac).
