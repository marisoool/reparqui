The positively charged hydrogen ion (H+) is the active constituent of all acids. Most of the body \u2019 s metabolic processes produce acids as their end products, but a somewhat alkaline body fluid (pH  7.4) is required as a medium for vital cellular activities. Therefore, chemical exchanges of hydrogen ions must take place continuously in order to maintain a state of equilibrium. An optimal pH (hydrogen ion concentration) between 7.35 and 7.45 must be maintained; otherwise, the enzyme systems and other biochemical and metabolic activities will not function normally. Although the body can tolerate and compensate for slight deviations in acidity and alkalinity, if the pH drops below 7.30, the potentially serious condition of acidosis exists. If the pH goes higher than 7.50, the patient is in a state of alkalosis . In either case the disturbance of the acid \u2013 base balance is considered serious, even though there are control mechanisms by which the body can compensate for an upward or downward change in the pH. Shifts in the pH of body fluids  are controlled by three major regulatory systems that may be classified as  chemical (the buffer systems), biological (blood and cellular activity), and physiological (the lungs and kidneys). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to categorize four primary acid \u2013 base disturbances: respiratory acidosis (increased PCO 2 ), respiratory alkalosis (decreased PCO 2 ), metabolic acidosis (decreased extracellular base excess), or metabolic alkalosis (increased extracellular base excess). The anion gap is calculated to detect the presence of unidentified anions in plasma. This  approach works well with clinical problems when serum total protein, albumin, and phosphate concentrations are approximately normal. The strong-ion difference method of evaluating acid-base balance, based on the concept that pH is primarily determined by PCO 2 , strong ion difference (SID), and nonvolatile buffer concentration (A TOT ) and categorizes acidbase disturbances into six categories: respiratory acidosis and alkalosis, strong ion acidosis and alkalosis, nonvolatile buffer ion acidosis and alkalosis.

First calf heifer,  dairy cattle between first and second calf. Calf and yearling may be  classified as bull or heifer. Cow, female after  first calf. Bull, entire male  over 2 years old. Castrated male, steer or bullock. Steer calf to 1 year. Stag adult, castrated when mature. Lamb, birth to weaning (average 4 months). Weaner, 4 months to 2-tooth. 2-tooth, to 15 months. 4-tooth, to 2 years. 6-tooth, to 3 years. Full mouth, to 4 years. All groups may be subdivided into ram and ewe groups. Females are ewe lambs, 2-tooth ewes, etc. Maiden ewes, first lambing. Gimmer, ewe that has not borne a  lamb. Adult entire males are rams or tups. Castrated males are wethers or hoggets or hoggs; these may also be subdivided into age groups, e.g., 2tooth hoggets. Piglet, birth to undetermined period, usually weaning. Suckler, birth to weaning. Weaner, after weaning to attainment of approximately 30 kg, or 65 pounds, body-weight. Boar, entire male over 6 months old, usually for breeding but not necessarily so. Gilt, young female in breeding herd not yet farrowed. Sow, female that has farrowed. First litter sow or first litter gilt, after  first farrowing. Barrow, castrated  male in fattening herd. Foal, birth to 1 year, filly or colt foal. Yearling,  1 \u2013 2 years, filly or colt. Then, 2 year old, 3 year old, and so on. Filly  \u2013 under 4 years. Mare \u2013 4 years and over. Then, classified on a use basis  \u2013 e.g., brood mare. Colt \u2013 2 \u2013 4 years. Stallion \u2013 entire male 4 years and over. Gelding \u2013 castrated male any age.

Kittens until sexual maturity at 5 \u2013 6 months for females, slightly older for males. Chicken, hatching to 4 weeks. Pullet, 4 weeks to 5 months. Cockerel, 4 weeks to 5 months. Rooster and hen, over 5 months. Turkeys, as for fowls except that young birds are poults and adult males are toms.

Peak and trough serum monitoring during treatment is most important in neonates, in dehydrated or otherwise hypovolemic patients, and in any animal with renal compromise when bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility results indicate that aminoglycosides are the best choice.

Antimicrobial agents are classified functionally according to the manner  in which they adversely affect a microorganism. Some interfere with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This results in cell lysis in a hypotonic environment. A weakening of the cell wall causes the cell to rupture, spill its contents, and be destroyed. The penicillins, cephalosporins, and bacitracin are examples of this group of antimicrobials. A second group of antimicrobial agents interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids. Without DNA and RNA synthesis, a microorganism cannot replicate or translate genetic information. Examples of antimicrobials that exert this kind of action are griseofulvin, fluoroquinolones and  rifampicin. A third group of antimicrobial agents change the permeability of the cell membrane, causing a leakage of metabolic substrates essential to the life of the microorganism. Their action can be either bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Examples include amphotericin B and polymyxin B. A fourth group of antimicrobial agents interfere with metabolic processes within the microorganism. They are structurally similar to natural metabolic substrates, but since they do not function normally, they interrupt metabolic processes. Most of these agents are bacteriostatic. Examples include the sulfonamides, trimethoprim, aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and isoniazid (INH). A fifth group interfere with translation of  proteins by the ribosome. This action may be bacteriocidal, if errors in translation are induced (aminoglycosides) or bacteriostatic, if translation is inhibited (macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol).", "@r:@a.|antimicrobial@:r@ resistance": "ability of a microorganism to resist the effects of an antimicrobial agent.
