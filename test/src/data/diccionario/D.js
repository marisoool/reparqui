DNA is present in all body cells of every species, including unicellular organisms and DNA viruses. The structure of DNA was first described in 1953 by J.D. Watson  and F.H.C. Crick. DNA molecules are long linear polymers of small molecules called nucleotides , each of which consists of one molecule of the five-carbon sugar  deoxyribose bonded to a phosphate group and to one of four heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds referred to as bases. A single strand of DNA is made by linking the nucleotides together in a chain with bonds between the sugar and phosphate groups of adjacent nucleotides. It thus consists of a backbone of alternating sugar and phosphate groups with a base attached to each sugar as a side chain. The four bases are two purines, adenine (A) and guanine (G), and two pyrimidines, cytosine (C) and thymine (T). Single-stranded DNA can be synthesized with any specified sequence of bases, but in living cells the  base sequence has a meaning; it specifies the amino acid sequence of  all of the polypeptides and proteins made by the cell. And since all of the enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions are proteins, the DNA contains the specifications for all of the biochemistry and structure of  the cell. The chemical basis of the genetic code lies in the ability of the bases to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Unlike the covalent bonds holding together the atoms of a single strand of DNA, hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken and reformed. Hydrogen bonding is governed by the base pairing rule: A always bonds with T, and C always bonds with G. A and T (or C and G) are called complementary bases . The genetic information is read and preserved by the matching up of complementary bases. In cells, the DNA is double stranded. The configuration of the  DNA molecule resembles a ladder in which the sides are the sugar \u2013 phosphate backbones, which are antiparallel (they run in opposite directions), and the rungs are hydrogen-bonded complementary bases; thus, the entire sequence along the two strands is complementary. This whole structure is twisted so that the two strands form a double helix. Once before each cell division, a group of proteins splits the two strands apart, and as complementary nucleotides bond to the bases of each strand they are jointed to form a new strand. This process is called replication. It results in the exact duplication of the DNA molecule, because each strand serves as a template (pattern) for the synthesis of its complementary strand. When the cell divides, one copy goes to each daughter cell. Thus, the genetic information is passed on from generation to generation without change except for rare mutations, which result from copying errors or incorrectly repaired breaks in the DNA molecule that change the base sequence. The reading of the genetic code involves two processes: transcription and translation. In transcription, a length of DNA is used as a template to make a complementary strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a nucleic acid like DNA. The only differences are that the sugar, ribose, has an extra oxygen atom, and the pyrimidine base, uracil (U), which also pairs with adenine, replaces thymine. In translation, the mRNA molecule is read by a structure called a ribosome, which produces the polypeptide specified  by the mRNA message. The genetic code is a triplet code. Every triplet of bases along the strand specifies a single amino acid. There are 64  possible triplets (codons) that can be formed from the four bases. Each one specifies that one of 20 different amino acids be inserted in a growing  polypeptide chain or marks either the start or the end of a chain. Two other types of RNA are involved in translation. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms a large part of the ribosome. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the means by which codons are matched with amino acids. tRNAs are small molecules with several self-complementary sections so that they fold up into a compact structure owing to bonding between complementary bases. One end of the molecule is a three-base anticodon, which bonds to its complementary codon on mRNA molecules. The other end is recognized by a specific enzyme which attaches the correct amino acid  to it. During translation, the ribosome proceeds along the mRNA molecule, and, as each codon is matched by a specific tRNA, the amino  acid it carries is transferred to the growing polypeptide chain, and the process is repeated until the \u2018 stop \u2019 codon is reached. Like the mRNA molecules, rRNA and tRNA molecules are formed on DNA templates; the genetic material contains not only the information for polypeptide sequences but also for rRNA and tRNA sequences. The chromosomes of mammalian cells contain 3 \u00d7 10 9 base pairs, which is enough to code for the 100,000 or so enzymes and structural proteins. Less than 10% of the DNA codes for proteins and RNA, the rest is noncoding, also referred to as \u2018 junk \u2019 DNA and is of uncertain purpose.

Type 2, or non \u2013 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is caused by a relative lack of insulin and insulin resistance. This is the form seen in most cats with diabetes mellitus.

Clinical signs include polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss despite an increased appetite. Persistent fasting hyperglycemia, glucosuria and sometimes ketonuria are present.
