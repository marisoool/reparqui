Called also sweetbread. During the last stages of fetal life and the early neonatal period, the reticular structure of the thymus entraps immature stem cells arising from the bone marrow and circulating in the blood. The thymus preprocesses these cells, causing them to become antigen-specific and therefore capable of maturing into a type of  lymphocyte that is essential to the regulation of immune responses generally and the development of cell-mediated immunity . More than 90% of T lymphocytes produced in the thymus are destroyed there in a process sometimes referred to as clonal purging, which is conceptually associated with the removal of self-reactive cells, i.e., only non \u2013 self-reactive cells leave the thymus. After development in the thymus, these lymphocytes re-enter the blood and are transported to developing secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes and spleen, where they seed the cells that eventually become thymus-dependent or T lymphocytes. If the thymus is removed or becomes nonfunctional during fetal life, the secondary lymphoid tissue and blood fail to become seeded with the T lymphocytes and the body's cell-mediated arm of immunity fails to develop. It is this arm of immunity that is mainly responsible for rejection of organ transplants and resistance to microbial infection, and plays a role in the elimination of cells potentially able to give rise to cancer.", "@r:@t.|thymus@:r@ atrophy": "leads to failure of the cell-mediated arm of the body's immunity.", "thymus-derived": "originating in the thymus.", "@r:@t.|thymus-derived@:r@-d. lymphocytes": "see T lymphocyte .", "Thynnascaris": "a genus of nematodes in the family Anasakidae.
