The mechanisms of immunity are essentially concerned with the body's ability to recognize and dispose of substances that it interprets as foreign and sometimes harmful to its well-being. When such a substance enters the body, complex chemical and mechanical activities are set into motion to defend and protect the body's cells and tissues. The foreign substance, usually a protein, is called an antigen , that is, one that generates the production of an antagonist. The most readily recognized response to the antigen is the production of antibody . The antigen \u2013 antibody reaction is an essential component of the overall immune response. Of equal or greater importance to antibody, particularly for some antigens, is the development of so-called cell-mediated immune response, which involves clonal expansion of specifically reactive T lymphocytes including cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (T c lymphocytes) that play a major role in eliminating the foreign antigens that are cell associated. Immunological responses in animals can be divided into two broad categories: humoral immunity, which refers to the production of antibody that becomes part of the body fluids (humors),  especially serum, and cell-mediated, or cellular immunity, which involves a variety of activities designed to destroy or at least contain cells that are recognized by the body as expressing foreign antigens on their cell surface, e.g., viral antigens.

The primary response begins immediately after the initial contact with an antigen; the resulting antibody, predominantly IgM, appears 48 \u2013 72 hours later.

Neonates that fail to acquire serum concentrations of IgG 1 greater than 10 mg/ml are at significantly higher risk of septicemic, enteric, and  respiratory disease.

Called also antibody. Immunoglobulins combine only with the antigen (or one closely related to it) that elicited their production. Immunoglobulins are major components of what is called the humoral immune response system. They are synthesized by B lymphocytes and their derivative plasma cells and are found in the serum and in other body fluids and tissues, including  the urine, spinal fluid, lymph nodes, and spleen. See also  immunity . Immunoglobulin molecules consist of two kinds of polypeptide chains: heavy chains (H-chains) and light chains (L-chains). There are five  antigenically different kinds of H-chains, designated \u03b3 , \u03bc , \u03b1 , \u03b4 , and \u03b5 , and this difference is the basis for the classification of immunoglobulins.  Classes vary in their chemical structure and in the number of antigenbinding sites. The five classes of immunoglobulins (Ig) are: IgG, IgM,  IgA, IgD, and IgE. Only IgG, IgM, and IgA are found in all species of domestic animals. IgA is present in low concentrations in the serum, but it is the major immunoglobulin of secretions and has a major first-line  defense role in infections that enter via mucosal surfaces. IgA in the serum is found primarily as a monomer. Secretory IgA, present in nonvascular fluids such as saliva, bile, synovial  fluid, and intestinal and  respiratory secretions, consists of two IgA molecules that are linked by a polypeptide called the secretory component and by a J chain. Production of secretory IgA is preferentially stimulated by local administration of antigens such as oral and intranasal immunizations. IgD was initially thought to only occur in primates, rodents, and a select group of mammalian species (e.g., dog, rabbit, guinea pig). With the availability of whole genome sequences, IgD or its homologs and orthologs have been found in many more mammalian species (e.g., sheep, cattle, and pig). It is found on the surface of immature B lymphocytes, often simultaneously with IgM. Its function remains unclear. IgE, once called reaginic antibody, is present in very low concentrations in serum of mammals and is generally present in increased concentrations in individuals with allergy. IgE binds to Fc receptors on the surface of cells particularly mast cells and basophils, via the Fc part of the molecule. Following exposure to antigen (allergen), and its binding to the Fab of two adjacent IgE molecules, perturbations of the cell membrane are produced, leading to the release of vasoactive amines, particularly histamine and serotonin, which are the mediators of anaphylaxis and atopic reactions, including urticaria, asthma, hay fever, and gastroenteritis. It is recognized in humans and dogs that there is an inherited (familial) predisposition for certain individuals to produce IgE. IgG is the most abundant of the five  classes of immunoglobulins, representing about 80% of serum immunoglobulin protein. It is the major antibody in the secondary humoral response of immunity, serves to activate the complement system, and is frequently involved in opsonization. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that crosses the placenta and is the major component of passive maternal antibody transfer via colostrum and yolk. The avian equivalent of IgG is termed IgY. IgM is the first antibody produced in the primary immune response. It  represents about 20% of serum antibodies. Like IgG, IgM bound to antigen activates the complement system, and together these two classes of immunoglobulins serve as specific antitoxins to neutralize diphtheria,  tetanus, botulism, and anthrax toxins and play a major role in defense against most infectious diseases.", "colostral i \u2019 s.": "colostrum contains a high concentration of IgG. Following ingestion, colostral IgG molecules are absorbed unchanged across the intestinal mucosa for the first 1  \u2013 2 days in cattle, dog, pig, and horse and for up to 4 days in the sheep and goat, and they provide circulating antibody to the newborn. A proportion is resecreted back into the intestinal lumen to provide some immunity against enteric disease.

Interferon is not itself an antiviral agent but rather acts as a stimulant to noninfected cells, causing them to synthesize another protein with antiviral characteristics, probably by initiating DNAdirected RNA synthesis and, thus, protein synthesis. The natural production of interferon is not restricted to viral infections; it can be released in response to a wide variety of inducers, including certain nonviral and infectious agents such as rickettsiae, bacteria, and synthetic double-strand RNA polymers. Interferon acts as a regulator of cell growth and has a variety of effects on the immune system by either activating or suppressing selected components of the immune system. For example, interferon can activate macrophages and thereby increase phagocytosis, enhance some primary antibody responses and inhibit others, enhance the expression of major histocompatibility antigens, and affect the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In regard to cell growth, interferon  has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of certain cells. There are three distinct interferon families. The type I interferon family encompasses interferon- \u03b1 , interferon- \u03b2 , and a number of poorly defined single gene  products. Almost all cells can produce type I interferons, and this usually occurs in response to stimulation of pattern recognition receptors by microbial products. The type II interferon family consists of interferon \u03b3 , which is mainly produced by T cells and natural killer cells. The type III interferon family includes interferon- \u03bb 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have similar function to cytokines of the type I interferon family.", "interfibrillar": "[ in \u2033 t \u04d9 r-fi\u2032  bril- \u04d9 r ] between fibrils.", "interfilar": "[ in \u2033 t \u04d9 r-fi\u2032  l \u04d9 r ] between or among the fibrils of a reticulum.", "interictal": "[ in \u2033 t \u04d9 r-ik \u2032 t \u04d9 l ] the period between attacks, fits or paroxysms.", "interkinesis": "[ in \u2033 t \u04d9 r-k \u012d -ne \u2032 sis ] the period between the first and second  divisions in meiosis.
