Accordingly, the 2003 EU-Directive No 1915/2003 directs every member state to establish a breeding program based on scrapie resistance. Most countries have programs that have marked similarities and have both voluntary and compulsory aspects. Examples are the National Scrapie Plan in the UK, a voluntary breeding program that genotypes both ewes and rams in a flock and encourages breeding  practices that will increase the frequency of resistant scrapie alleles and eradicate susceptible ones. The UK also has a Compulsory Scrapie Flocks Scheme where flocks with con firmed scrapie cases on their farms will  either have their sheep flocks genotype tested so that those animals more  susceptible to disease can be identified and removed or the whole  flock  slaughtered and disposed of.

Together they make up the International System of Units. The abbreviation SI, from the French Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s , is used in all languages. There are seven base SI units, defined by speci fied  physical measurements and two supplementary units. Units are derived for any other physical quantities by multiplication and division of the base and supplementary units. The derived units with special names are shown in Table 1. SI is a coherent system. This means that units are always combined without conversion factors. The derived unit of velocity is the meter per second (m/s); the derived unit of volume is the cubic meter (m 3 ). If you know that pressure is force per unit area, then you know that the SI unit of pressure (the pascal) is the unit of force divided by the unit of area and is therefore equal to 1 newton per square meter. The metric prefixes can be attached to any unit in order to make a unit  of a more convenient size. The symbol for the prefix is attached to the  symbol for the unit, e.g., nanometer (nm) = 10 \u2212 9 m. The units of mass are specified in terms of the gram, e.g., microgram (  \u03bc g) = 10 \u2212 9 kg. Only one prefix is used with a unit. The use of units such as the millimicrometer is no longer acceptable. When a unit is raised to a power, the  power applies to the prefix as well, e.g., a cubic millimeter (mm  3 ) = 10 \u2212 9 m 3 . When a prefix is used with a ratio unit, it should be in the  numerator rather than in the denominator, e.g., kilometers/second (km/ s) rather than meters/millisecond (m/ms). Only prefixes denoting powers  of 10 3 are normally used. Hecto-, deka-, deci-, and centi- are usually attached only to the metric system units, gram, meter, and liter. Owing to the force of tradition, one noncoherent unit, the liter, equal to 10 \u2212 3 m 3 or 1 dm 3 , is generally accepted for use with SI. The internationally accepted abbreviation for liter is the letter l; however, this can be confused with the numeral 1 in typescript. For this reason, the capital letter L is also sometimes used as a symbol for liter. The lowercase letter is generally used with prefixes, e.g., dl, ml,  fl. The symbols for all other SI  units begin with a capital letter if the unit is named after a person and with a lowercase letter otherwise.
