The distribution of pain receptors in the gastrointestinal mucosa apparently is similar to that in the skin; thus, the mucosa is quite sensitive to irritation and other painful stimuli. Although the parenchyma of the liver and the alveoli of the lungs are almost entirely insensitive to pain, the liver as an organ and the bile ducts are extremely sensitive, as are the bronchi, ureters, parietal pleura, and peritoneum. Some pain receptors are selective in their response to stimuli, but most are sensitive to more than one of the following types of excitation: (1) mechanical stress of trauma; (2) extremes of heat and cold; and (3) chemical substances, such as histamine, potassium ions, acids, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and acetylcholine. The conscious perception of pain probably takes place in the thalamus and lower centers; interpretation of the quality of pain is probably the role of the cerebral cortex. There are some naturally occurring internal systems in the body that are known to control pain but none of them has been completely verified.

Penicillins exert a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect on susceptible bacteria by interfering with the final stages of peptidoglycan  synthesis, a component of the bacterial cell wall. Despite their relatively low toxicity for the host, penicillins are active against many bacteria, especially gram-positive pathogens such as streptococci, some staphylococci and clostridia, as well as certain gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes ( Treponema pallidum and T. pertenue ), and fungi. Certain strains of some target species, for example, staphylococci, secrete the enzyme penicillinase , which inactivates penicillin and confers resistance to the antibiotic. Some of the staphylococcal penicillins, for example, methicillin, are more effective against penicillinase-producing organisms. An additional class of extended-spectrum penicillins has been approved for use; it includes piperacillin, ticarcillin, and mezlocillin. Penicillins are time-dependent antibiotics; they exert their optimal bactericidal effect when drug concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the pathogen. A typical target is to maintain drug concentrations 2 \u2013 4 times the MIC throughout the dosing interval. Unlike the concentration-dependent antibiotics, higher concentrations do not result in greater bactericidal activity, and there is little or no postantibiotic effect (PAE). There are four groups of penicillins: (1) the natural penicillins, penicillin G and penicillin V, have a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, mainly against gram-positive bacteria; (2) the aminopenicillins, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, and hetacillin, are semisynthetic derivatives that have a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms, but are susceptible to penicillinase; (3) penicillinase-resistant penicillins, which include cloxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and oxacillin; and (4) the extendedspectrum penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin), which are effective against gram-positive and gramnegative organisms (aerobes and anaerobes), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Allergic reaction to penicillin occurs with repeated exposure in some animals and ranges from urticaria to anaphylaxis, which may be fatal.

At any given time, about one-third of the total blood platelets can be found in the spleen; the remaining two-thirds are in the circulating blood. The functions of platelets are related to the clotting of blood. Because of their adhesion and aggregation capabilities, platelets can occlude small breaks in blood vessels and prevent the escape of blood.

Unless fertilization takes place, the corpus luteum regresses. The progesterone produced by the corpus luteum is promptly carried by the blood to the uterus, as was the estrogen that preceded it.
