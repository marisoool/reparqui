Fluorescent antibody (FA)  techniques can be used in place of time-consuming culture methods for identifying bacteria and viruses. There are two major types of FA techniques, direct and indirect, both of which are based on the antigen \u2013 antibody reaction in which the antibody attaches itself to its specific  antigen. In the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) method, the antibody  is bound to the antigen, for example, a bacterial cell in a smear, and cannot be easily removed by elution (washing). The antibody remains attached to the cell after all other serum proteins have been washed away. Since the antibody has been rendered fluorescent by conjugation with fluorescein or another dye, the outline of the bacterial cell that it coats  can readily be seen with a special microscope. In the indirect method (IFA), the specific antibody is allowed to react with the antigen. The slide  is then washed and treated with a labeled antibody to the specific  antibody. For example, if the specific antibody was raised in a rabbit, it  is then treated with fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit globulin, which results  in a combination of this labeled antibody with the rabbit immunoglobulin already attached to the antigen. Fluorescent antibody studies have been used in the detection of numerous bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections and in the identification and localization of many tissue  antigens.", "immunoelectron @r:@m.|microscopy@:r@": "the mixing of antibody with an antigen such as a virus on a specimen grid so as to increase the probability of visualizing a virus and to identify (type) the kind of virus present in the specimen, or antibody may be conjugated with gold and used to visualize and determine the location of specific antigenic determinants on a specimen.", "microsecond ( \u03bc s)": "[ mi \u2032 kro-sek \u2033 \u04d9 nd ] one-millionth (10 \u2212 6 ) of a second.", "microsomal": "[ mi \u2033 kro-so \u2032 m \u04d9 l ] pertaining to or emanating from microsome.", "microsomatic": "[ mi \u2033 kro-so-mat \u2032 ik ] having a poor sense of smell, e.g., primates.", "microsome": "[ mi \u2033 kro-som \u2032 ] any of the vesicular fragments of endoplasmic reticulum produced during disruption and centrifugation of cells.", "microsomia": "[ mi \u2033 kro-so \u2032 me- \u04d9 ] abnormally small size of the body.", "microspectroscope": "[ mi \u2033 kro-spek \u2032 tr \u04d9 -sk \u014d p ] a spectroscope and microscope combined.", "microspherocyte": "[ mi \u2033 kro-sfe \u2032 ro-s \u012b t ] spherocyte .", "microsphygmia": "[ mi \u2033 kro-sfig  \u2032 me- \u04d9 ] that condition of the pulse in which it is perceived with difficulty by the  finger.", "microsplenia": "[ mi \u2033 kro-sple \u2032 ne- \u04d9 ] smallness of the spleen.", "Microsporidia": "[ mi \u2033 kro-sp \u04d9 -rid \u2032 e- \u04d9 ] a phylum of spore-forming protozoa characterized by having small spores and one polar capsule.

Skeletal muscle fibers range in length from  a few millimeters to many centimeters. They also vary in color from white to deep red. Each muscle fiber receives its own nerve impulses, which  trigger fine and varied motions.

At least two major types of muscle fiber have been identi fied by histochemical  techniques: type I (red) fibers, which have a slow contraction; and type  II (white) fibers, which have a fast contraction. Some muscles are  attached to bones by tendons. Others are attached to other muscles, and to skin, producing, for example, the skin twitch, the eye blink, and hair erection.
