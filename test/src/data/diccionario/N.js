Each kidney is an aggregation of many nephrons. The specific function of the nephron is to remove from the  blood plasma certain end-products of metabolism, such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine, and to regulate excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and other ions. By allowing for reabsorption of water and some electrolytes back into the blood, the nephron also plays a vital role in the maintenance of normal fluid balance in the body. The nephron is a  complex system of tubules. Blood is brought to the nephron via the afferent arteriole. As the blood flows through the glomerulus (a network  of capillaries), about one-fifth of the plasma is  filtered through the  glomerular membrane and collects in the glomerular (Bowman's) capsule, which encases the glomerulus. The fluid then passes through the proximal  tubule, from there into the loop of Henle, then into the distal tubule, andfinally into the collecting tubule (collecting duct). As the  fluid is making  its tortuous journey through these various tubules, most of its water and some of the solutes are reabsorbed into the blood via the peritubular capillaries.
