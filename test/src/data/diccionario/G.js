Many phenotypic characteristics are determined by a single gene, while others are multigenic. Genes are specifically located in linear  order along the single DNA molecule that makes up each chromosome. All eukaryotic cells contain a diploid (2n) set of chromosomes so that two copies of each gene, one derived from each parent, are present in each cell; the two copies often specify a different phenotype, i.e., the polypeptide will have a somewhat different amino acid composition. These alternative forms of gene, both within and between individuals, are called alleles. Genes determine the physical (structural genes), the biochemical (enzymes), physiological, and behavioral characteristics of an animal. The formation of gametes (sperm, ova) involves a process of meiosis, which allows crossing over between four pairs of chromosomes, two derived from each parent, which means that new forms of a particular chromosome are created. Gamete formation also results in cells (gametes) with a haploid (n) set of chromosomes that in fertilization creates a new individual, which is a recombinant of 2n chromosomes, half derived by way of the ovum from the mother and half via the spermatozoa from the father. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of a gene, either by substitution of a different nucleotide or by deletion or insertion of other nucleotides, constitute mutations that add to the diversity of animal species by creating different alleles and can be used as a basis for genetic selection of different phenotypes.

At sexual maturity, each ovary has a large number of immature follicles, each of which contains an undeveloped egg cell. These structures are called primordial, or primitive, follicles. At varying intervals in the different animal species, one of these follicles develops to maturity, or ripens; as it does so the animal shows the signs of sexual receptivity known as estrus . As the follicle ripens, it increases in size. The ovum within becomes larger, the follicular wall becomes thicker, and fluid collects in the follicle and surrounds the egg. At this point, it  is also known as a vesicular or antral ovarian follicle. The follicle also secretes estradiol, the hormone that prepares the endometrium to receive a fertilized egg. As the follicle matures, it moves to the surface of the ovary and forms a projection. When fully mature, the graafian follicle  breaks open and releases the ovum, which passes into the uterine tubes. This release of the ovum is called ovulation . The released ovum travels down the uterine tube to the uterus. Meanwhile, the empty graafian follicle  in the ovary becomes transformed into the corpus luteum, or yellow body, by becoming filled with cells containing a yellow substance. The corpus  luteum secretes progesterone, a hormone that causes further change in the endometrium, allowing it to provide a good milieu in which a fertilized ovum can grow through the stages of gestation to become a fetus.", "atretic @r:@g.|graafian follicle@:r@ f.": "a follicle that enlarges and then regresses without proceeding to ovulation; occurs normally in animals as waves of follicles developing and regressing during estrous cycles and sometimes during pregnancy; occurs also in seasonally anestrous females.
