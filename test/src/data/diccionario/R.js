In many countries, this is now the more common cause of the disease. The disease is related to European Brown Hare syndrome but cross-transmission between hares and rabbits of either virus does not occur; spread is by contact, possibly by infected feces, fomites, possibly by spread of carrion by birds, and by recently contaminated insects such as flies. After infection, rabbits show few clinical signs other than  depression and immobility and die after an illness of about 18 hours. Characteristic gross necropsy lesions are enlargement of the liver and spleen and small, focal, pulmonary hemorrhages. There is massive liver necrosis that is believed to be the trigger for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Rabbits less than 6 weeks of age are curiously not susceptible to fatal disease.

Rabies virus has a broad host range, but in wildlife the disease persists primarily in bats, which may be true reservoirs, and in terrestrial carnivores. The causative lyssavirus is transmitted in the saliva and the principal method of infection of domestic animals is by a bite. The principal sources for domestic animal infections are in Europe, the red fox, arctic fox, bats, and more recently the exotic Asian raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes procyonoides ). In North America they are raccoons, striped skunks, red fox, gray fox, and bats. Mongoose, jackals, and the hyenas are important sources in Africa, and in some countries, there is a persistent cycling of infection in wild dogs. In domestic animals, separate furious and dumb (paralytic) forms are described but both commonly occur in the one animal. The syndrome includes an ascending paralysis that may be preceded by a period of mania and aggression and is followed by death. In cattle, bellowing and yawning (voiceless bellowing) occurs, and drooling of saliva and pharyngeal paralysis are common in all species. Rabies is one of the most important of the zoonoses because of the inevitably fatal outcome for the infected human. A recombinant vaccinia virus expressing rabies virus glycoprotein G has been used in extensive oral wildlife vaccination campaigns to control rabies in Europe and North America and has been successful in reducing the incidence, especially in Europe, but there are variants of the rabies virus, particularly in skunks, against which the current recombinant vaccina vaccine is ineffective.

An isotope of a chemical element consists of atoms having the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.

The emissions from radioactive decay can consist of electrons (beta particles), or electromagnetic energy in the form of photons, or helium ions (alpha particles). (See also radiation .) The process of decay can produce a product that is itself unstable, in which case it too will decay. The process continues until a stable nuclide is finally formed.

RNA is similar in composition to DNA with two exceptions: the sugar in RNA is ribose (in DNA it is deoxyribose) and in RNA the pyrimidine uracil replaces the thymidine of DNA. The structure of RNA varies from helical to uncoiled linear strands of varying lengths, depending on the number of nucleotides forming the strand. This variance in structure is evident in the different types of RNA. For example, transfer RNA ( tRNA ) contains only about 75 nucleotides, while some mRNAs may contain thousands of nucleotides. Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) receives its name from its function of carrying the genetic code from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to the cytoplasm, where proteins are synthesized. The transfer of the genetic code from DNA to mRNA is called transcription. Molecules of mRNA migrate to the cytoplasm and bind to ribosomes, to form polyribosomes. RNA moves along the ribosomes and its information content as codons (three nucleotides) is translated into a particular sequence of amino acids, i.e., a protein or polypeptide. Stop codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, terminate translation of mRNA. Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) called also soluble RNA, brings about the transfer of specific amino acid molecules to the growing  protein molecules during the synthesis of proteins. Each of the 20 common amino acids found in protein molecules has a corresponding type of tRNA. Thus, a specific tRNA carries the appropriate amino  acid to its appropriate place in the nascent chain of the protein molecule being synthesized. tRNA has a triplet of nucleotides called the anticodon which is able, by base pairing to the codon triplet in mRNA, to place the amino acids in the specific order characteristic  of the particular protein. See also t RNA . Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is so called because it is found as a major structural component of ribosomes that are the cytoplasmic organelle required for linking of amino acids into protein molecules. Large amounts of RNA are also found in the nucleus of cells. One class of nuclear RNA, called heterogeneous RNA ( hnRNA ), represents primary RNA transcripts, i.e., RNA before processing, including splicing of introns, to form mRNA. A second class of nuclear RNA is called small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) one species of which, called small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( snRNP ), is believed to play an important role in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA.
