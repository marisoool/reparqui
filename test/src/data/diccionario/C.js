All living cells arise from other cells, either by division of one cell to make two, as in mitosis and meiosis, or by fusion of two cells to make one, as in the union of the sperm and ovum to make the zygote in sexual reproduction. Cells are bounded by cell membrane or plasma membrane , which is a lipid bilayer composed of two layers of phospholipids. Each layer is one molecule thick with the charged, hydrophilic end of the lipid molecules on the surface of the membrane and the uncharged hydrophobic fatty acid tails in the interior of the membrane. Cells are divided into two classes, eukaryote(s) , which have a true nucleus and are found in higher plants and animals, fungi, protozoa and most algae, and prokaryote(s) , which are without a nucleus and found in bacteria. The lipid bilayer of eukaryotic cells is impermeable to many substances, such as ions, sugars and amino acids; however, membrane proteins selectively move specific  substances through the cell membrane by active or passive transport. Water, gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and nonpolar compounds pass through the cell membrane by diffusion . Materials can also be engulfed and taken into the cell enclosed in a portion of the cell membrane. This is called phagocytosis when solids are ingested and pinocytosis when liquids are ingested. The reverse process is called exocytosis . All of these processes permit the cell to maintain an internal environment different from its exterior. See also body See also bodyfluid  .

The basic components of connective tissue are cells and extracellular protein fibers embedded in a matrix or ground substance of  large carbohydrate molecules and carbohydrate \u2013 protein complexes called mucopolysaccharides. For the sake of clarity and organization, collagen diseases may be divided into two major groups: (1) those that are genetically determined and are a result of structural and biochemical defects, and (2) those that are acquired and in which immunological and inflammatory reactions are taking place within the tissues. Among  the first group are those diseases caused by a lack of a speci fic enzyme  necessary for proper storage and excretion of one or more mucopolysaccharides, such as Ehlers \u2013 Danlos syndrome . These disorders are distinguished by structural defects affecting the formation of collagen. Acquired connective tissue diseases are believed to develop as a result of at least two causative factors: a genetic factor and an abnormal immunological response.

A term commonly used to describe an epileptic seizures. Seizures are symptomatic of an abnormally functioning cerebral cortex or diencephalon - they are not in themselves a disease entity. In animals, they are most often caused by idiopathic epilepsy, inflammatory conditions or  primary brain tumors. Convulsions are also produced by any of a number of metabolic disorders, such as hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia and hormonal imbalances; brain cell injury from head trauma, tumors and degenerative neural disease; anoxia and hemorrhage which deprive brain cells of vital substances; and acute cerebral edema which interferes with normal brain cell function. Recurrent seizures are known as epilepsy which may be divided into primary, secondary and reactive forms. Called also fit, ictus.

Cryptosporidiosis in humans is mainly caused by C. hominis or C. parvum . C. canis, C. felis or C. meleagridis have been recorded. Human cryptosporidiosis is proposed to be transmitted anthroponotically (human-to-human) for C. hominis and C. parvum , or zoonotically (animal-to-human) for C. parvum . The transmission of C. canis and C. meleagridis to humans is not well characterized. Transmission is seen in so called \"petting farms\" where children are close to animals, swimming pools (resistant to chlorination) and where surface water is used for drinking water. In many cases, cryptosporidiosis resolves as immunity develops to eliminate or suppress the infection, although chronic infections can develop in high-risk host groups, particularly neonates and immuno-compromised or -suppressed patients which, due in part to the limited availability of highly effective chemotherapeutic treatment, can result in death.
