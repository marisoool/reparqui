Sound frequencies in the range of 1 million to 10 million hertz are used in diagnostic ultrasonography. The lower frequencies provide a greater depth of penetration and are used to examine deeper abdominal organs; those in the upper range provide less penetration but better resolution and are used predominantly to examine more superficial structures such  as the tendons and superficial abdominal organs. The basic principle of  ultrasonography is the same as that of depth-sounding in oceanographic studies of the ocean floor. The ultrasonic waves are con fined to a narrow  beam that may be transmitted through, refracted, absorbed, scattered or reflected by the medium toward that they are directed, depending on the  nature of the surface they strike. In diagnostic ultrasonography the ultrasonic waves are produced by electrically stimulating piezoelectric crystals within the transducer. As the sound beam strikes an interface or boundary between tissues of varying acoustic impedance (e.g., muscle and blood) some of the sound waves are reflected back to the transducer  as echoes. The echoes are then converted into electrical impulses and an image. Ultrasonography can be utilized in examination of all body systems including the heart (echocardiography) the abdominal organs, eye, soft tissues of the body such as thyroid and lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal structures. Ultrasonography is limited to the evaluation of the surface of the normal lung of the lungs because most of the sound is reflected by the air interface.
