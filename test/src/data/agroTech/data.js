In mammalian cells, actin exists intwo  forms:  G-actin  (monomeric  form)  and  F-actin  (polymerized  chain  molecule  form).  The  cell’sactin is frequently polymerized (i.e., forms the molecular chains of F-actin) and depolymerized (i.e.,the molecular chains break apart again into the individual “chain links” known as G-actin), as neededby the cell.Via its contractions, F-actin is involved in eucaryote cells’Movement (e.g., when it “pulls” the cell to a new position) within an organism’s body, muchlike a towrope. The “towrope” utilized is a long narrow structure extending from the exteriorof cell, called a “filopodium,” which is composed of actin surrounded by a layer of the cell’splasma membrane.Note: A protein known as N-WASP in breast cancer cells works in concert with actin to formbranches bearing sharp external points on the cell surface by rearranging the cell’s internalactin  “skeleton.”  Those  branches  with  sharp  points  are  known  as  “pseudopodia,”  and  thepseudopodia can grab onto and poke holes into the extracellular matrix (i.e., the supportivetissue  located  in  between  individual  cells).  Breast  cancer  cells  attach  enzymes  to  thepseudopodia and “dig into” the extracellular matrix, creating larger spaces for breast cancerto move into (i.e., beginning of metastasis process).Changes in the shape/morphology of the cell (e.g., in response to chemical signals such as agrowth factor molecule encountering the exterior membrane of the cell).Separation of nuclear DNA during meiosis (dividing into two/reproductive step, in life of acell).In addition to being the raw material used by the cell for rapid formation of F-actin (filaments), Gactin also interacts with the cell’s nucleus (thereby activating expression of certain genes involved incell  differentiation,  cell  growth,  cell  proliferation,  and  the  F-actin  filaments,  which  control  cellshape/movement).During an animal’s development, some actin-rich protrusions form and extend from one individualmuscle cell to an adjacent individual muscle cell. As part of the animal’s maturation process, thatleads those two muscle cells (and many other individual muscle cells) to fuse into long myotubes(muscle fibers) that contain multiple cell nuclei.

Adiposetissue tends to increase in animals’ bodies if they consume more energy-dense food than needed fortheir level of energy expenditure (e.g., via exercise).In humans older than 40, an increase in the body’s amount of adi-pose tissue is correlated with anincreased risk of premature death (e.g., from coronary heart disease).Adipose tissue cells secrete a large number of compounds that impact the human body in a numberof ways. For example,Leptin—a  protein  hormone  signal  to  the  brain  that  the  body  has  “enough”  energy  stores,which also stimulates the body to consume calories faster.Visfatin—a  protein  that  has  some  of  the  same  effects  as  insulin  (e.g.,  stimulates  glucoseuptake by the body, which lowers blood sugar levels).Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)—a cytokine protein that initiates changes (inflammation)in  vascular  tissues  that  result  in  monocytes  adhering  to  internal  walls  of  blood  vessels,thereby becoming a macrophage and resulting in formation of a plaque deposit. Additionallyand separately, TNF-α can also cause some tissues to become insulin resistant.Angiotensin—a precursor molecule that can become angiotensin II in the body. The hormoneangiotensin II causes arteries to constrict (which can result in high blood pressure), promotesmacrophage  accumulation  into  plaque  deposits  on  blood  vessel  walls,  and  enhances  themetabolism of nitric oxide into free radical molecules.Adiponectin—a molecule that acts to inhibit the development of insulin resistance in tissuesand acts to inhibit inflammation.See also Fats, Coronary heart disease (CHD), Leptin, Lecithin, Choline, Visfatin, Insulin, Cytokines,Monocytes, Adhesion molecule, Macrophage, Plaque, Metabolism, Nitric oxide, Free radical.', 'Adipose Triglyceride Lipase': 'See Lipase.', 'Adjuvant (to a Herbicide)': 'From the Latin word for “aid,” it refers to any compound that enhances the effectiveness (i.e., weedkilling ability) of a given herbicide. For example, adjuvants such as surfactants can be mixed (prior toapplication to weeds) with herbicide (in water), in order to hasten transport of the herbicide’s activeingredient  into  the  weed  plant.  That  is  because  the  herbicide  must  move  from  an  aqueous  (water)environment  into  one  (i.e.,  the  weed  plant’s  cuticle  or  “skin”)  comprised  of  lipids/lipophilicmolecules, before it can accomplish its task. See also Surfactant, Lipids, Lipophilic.', 'Adjuvant (to a Pharmaceutical)': 'From the Latin word for “aid,” it refers to any compound that enhances the desired response by thebody  to  that  pharmaceutical.  For  example,  adjuvants  such  as  certain  polysaccharides  or  surfacemodified nanoparticles (e.g., pan-DR-binding epitope derivatized dendrimer nanoparticle acts as anadjuvant  to  amphotericin  B,  for  treatment  of  leishmaniasis  disease)  can  be  injected  along  with(vaccine) antigen in order to increase the immune response (e.g., production of antibodies) to a givenantigen.Another  example  is  that  consumption  of  grapefruit  juice  by  humans  will  increase  the  impact  ofcertain  pharmaceuticals.  Those  pharmaceuticals  include  some  sedatives,  antihypertensives,  theantihistamine terfenadine, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine. The adjuvant effect of grapefruitjuice  is  thought  to  be  caused  via  inhibition  of  the  enzyme  cytochrome  P4503A4,  which  catalyzesreactions involved in the metabolism (breakdown) of those pharmaceuticals.Another example is that consumption of the pharmaceutical known as clopidogrel (U.S. commercialname Plavix™) by people immediately following a mild heart attack (severe chest pain)—along withaspirin—greatly reduces the risk of death, strokes, and (new, additional) heart attacks versus takingaspirin alone after a mild heart attack.See  also  Cellular  immune  response,  Humoral  immunity,  Polysaccharides,  Nanotechnology,Antigen, Antibody, Enzyme, Metabolism, Histamine, Cyclosporine, Cytochrome P4503A4.', 'ADME': 'Acronym  for  absorption,  distribution  (within  the  body),  metabolism,  and  elimination  ofpharmaceuticals.

In  addition  to  bone  marrow,  these  adult  stem  cells  have  beenfound in liver, skin, adipose (fat), heart, testicle, intestine, menstrual blood, and brain tissue. Similarto human embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells can—under certain conditions—differentiate/proliferate into cell types specific to many of the human body’s 210 different types oftissue.For example, in 2013, Giuseppe Maria de Peppo and colleagues reprogrammed human skin cells (toact like stem cells) and inserted them into a bioreactor, where they grew into functional bone tissue. In2014, Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic reprogrammed human fat cells to become mesenchymal stem cellsthat underwent a condensation stage and then grew into functional cartilage tissue.For example, in 1980, Steven Teitelbaum and colleagues injected such cells from a donor into a 3.5-month-old girl who had the disease known as “osteopetrosis,” which in that era almost always killedits victims in the first year of their life. Those adult stem cells differentiated/proliferated and that girllived a long lifespan.For  example,  in  2004,  Nagy  Habib  injected  such  cells  from  a  patient  who  was  suffering  fromcirrhosis  of  the  liver,  into  the  patient’s  own  hepatic  artery  in  the  liver.  Those  adult  stem  cellsrepopulated the liver and improved its function (i.e., reversed at least some of the liver cirrhosis).Also,  numerous  researchers  have  reported  that  injecting  adult  stem  cells  taken  from  the  bonemarrow into the coronary arteries of patients who have “chronic ischemia” (a particular form of heartdisease)  results  in  neovasculogenesis  (formation  of  new  blood  vessels,  which  lessens  the  chronicischemia).Adult stem cells are being utilized in treatments administered to humans for more than 100 diseasesand conditions. In 2012, Sadia Mohsin discovered that when PIM-1 (a protein molecule that promotescell survival and growth) is added by man to adult stem cells that have been removed via biopsy froman (aged) heart, those adult stem cells are rejuvenated because telomerase enzyme activity is enhanced(resulting  in  elongation  of  the  cells’  telomeres)  and  stem  cell  proliferation  is  increased  (when  thePIM-1-modified stem cells are reinserted into the heart muscle).See  also  Cell,  Stem  cells,  Multipotent  adult  stem  cell,  Stem  cell  growth  factor  (SCF),  Protein,Differentiation,  Bioreactor,  Scaffolding  (utilized  in  tissue  engineering),  Hematopoietic  stem  cells,Adipose, Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), Coronary heart disease (CHD), Angiogenesis, Telomerase,Telomeres.', 'Adventitious': 'From the Latin adventitius meaning “not properly belonging to.” The term can be utilized to refer toPlant shoots emanating from sites other than typical ones (e.g., from a plant’s leaves)A small amount of transgenic grain accidentally mixed into other grain, etc.See also Transgenic.', 'Aerobe': 'A microorganism that requires oxygen to live (respire).

If there isno naturally occurring “lock” inherent on the desired protein molecule (to go with the ligand’s “key”),then the scientist can add an affinity tag during the synthesis of the protein (e.g., in a cell-free geneexpression system) to act as that protein molecule’s “key.”The other proteins in the solution wash through the column because they were not able to bind tothe ligand. Once the column is devoid of the other proteins, an appropriate wash solution is passedthrough  the  column,  which  causes  the  protein/ligand  complex  to  dissociate.

The  antibodies  (IgE)  bind  to  those  antigens  andtrigger a humoral immune response, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, skin reactions (e.g., hives),blood pressure decline, wheezing, and respiratory distress. In severe cases, the immune response cancause death.In some rare instances, the allergic reaction is mediated by sensitized T cells.In some rare instances, the onset of a food allergy incident is induced by exercise (done before orafter eating that particular food).The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  requires  testing  in  advance  to  determine  if  agenetically engineered foodstuff has the potential to cause allergic reactions in humans, before thatgenetically engineered foodstuff (e.g., a modified crop plant) is approved by the FDA.In general, known food allergens (e.g., in peanuts, Brazil nuts, wheat) are protein molecules that areresistant to rapid digestion (e.g., because those protein molecules are too tightly “folded together” fordigestive enzymes to access their chemical bonds to break down). One potential way to geneticallyengineer currently allergenic crops (e.g., wheat) to make them less allergenic is to insert gene(s) forextra production of thioredoxin.Thioredoxin  is  a  protein  found  in  all  living  organisms,  which  “targets”  and  breaks  down  thechemical  bonds  holding  together  a  tightly  folded  together  protein  molecule  (thereby  making  thoseprotein  molecules  easier  to  digest),  so  future  crops  engineered  to  contain  more  thioredoxin  thantraditional average level may be less allergenic.

Alzheimer’s disease causes certain proteins to mis-foldand aggregate in the brain, resulting in progressive memory loss and dementia in its victims as it killsbrain  cells  (neurons).  AβPs  are  also  harmful  to  the  blood  vessels  that  supply  the  brain—therebyfurther  accelerating  the  cognitive  decline  of  Alzheimer’s  disease  by  restricting  the  flow  of  bloodborne oxygen and nutrients.Some human haplotypes are more susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease than others. Women tend toget Alzheimer’s disease significantly more often than men of the same age. Black people in NorthAmerica tend to get Alzheimer’s disease significantly more often than Caucasians in North America.Alzheimer’s  disease  begins  within  the  brain’s  lateral  entorhinal  cortex  (LEC).  The  LEC  is  the“gateway” to the brain’s hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the consolidation of long-termmemory, among its other functions. So if the LEC is affected by Alzheimer’s, other properties of thehippocampus  will  also  inevitably  be  adversely  impacted.  The  LEC  is  particularly  vulnerable  toAlzheimer’s  disease  because  it  normally  accumulates  tau,  which  sensitizes  the  LEC  to  anyaccumulation there of amyloid precursor protein. Together, these two proteins damage neurons in theLEC.With  time,  the  Alzheimer’s  disease  spreads  from  the  LEC  directly  to  other  parts  of  the  brain’scerebral  cortex—in  particular,  to  the  parietal  cortex,  a  region  of  the  brain  that  is  involved  in  thebody’s spatial orientation and navigation.Some  drugs  (e.g.,  tacrine,  donepezil)  appear  to  slow  the  progression  of  Alzheimer’s  disease  (byincreasing  the  availability  of  acetylcholine  in  the  brain),  but  there  is  currently  no  way  to  stop  thedisease.

Discovered to be triggered and stimulatedby angiogenic growth factors, in the early 1980s. For example, when heart arteries are clogged byarteriosclerosis,  increased  production  of  “granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor”  canstimulate development of new blood vessels (to sometimes restore blood flow).Angiogenesis is required for malignant tumors to metastasize (spread throughout the body), becauseit provides the (newly created) blood supply that tumors require. For example, the gene that codes forthe  production  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  is  greatly  upregulated  by  chemicalsignals  that  are  produced  by  hepatocarcinoma  tumors.  Some  tumors  produce  transforming  growthfactor-beta to activate blood vessel formation.Angiogenesis  is  crucial  to  the  development  of  glaucoma  and  age-related  macular  degeneration(AMD), a major cause of blindness in older people. In the case of the “wet” form of AMD, the body’sproduction of VEGF can cause creation/growth of blood vessels in front of the retina/macula, whicheventually leads to blindness. Research indicates that siRNA-based drugs might be able to prevent“wet” AMD via prevention of (over)production of VEGF by the body.Another pathway (independent of VEGF) that can cause creation/growth of blood vessels in front ofthe retina/macula can occur via activation of the molecule neuropilin 1 (NRP1) produced by certainconnective tissue components within the eyeball. The NRP1 subsequently conveys signals inside theblood vessel cells via another molecule named ABL1 and thereby stimulates blood vessel growth.Angiogenesis can also contribute to rheumatoid arthritis via development of new (inappropriate)blood vessels in the joints.The drug thalidomide is also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, as are the monoclonal antibodypharmaceutical  known  as  bevacizumab  and  the  proteins  “angiostatin”  and  “endostatin.”  See  alsoAngiogenic  growth  factors,  Granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF),  Nitricoxide,  Rheumatoid  arthritis,  Arteriosclerosis,  Tumor,  Cancer,  Metastasis,  Gene,  Up-regulation,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Age-relatedmacular  degeneration  (AMD),  Short  interfering  RNA  (siRNA),  Anti-angiogenesis,  Pathway,Signaling, Signaling molecule, Chiral compound, Angiostatin, Endostatin, Bevacizumab, Nanofibers.', 'Angiogenesis Factors': 'See Angiogenic growth factors.', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors': 'Refer to compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals, interleukin-18) that work to inhibit/stop angiogenesis (i.e.,formation/development of new blood vessels).

For example, the membrane transporter proteinmolecules known as “ABC transporters” are sometimes able to help pathogenic bacteria resistcertain antibiotics by transporting out the antibiotic before it can kill the bacteria. The ABCtransporter is a V-shaped molecule embedded in the (bacteria) cell’s plasma membrane, withthe “open end” of the “V” pointed toward the interior of the cell. When molecules of certainantibiotics (inside the cell) contact the ABC transporter molecule, the two “arms” of the ABCtransporter close around the antibiotic molecule; the ABC transporter flips over and therebysends the antibiotic molecule out through the exterior of the cell’s plasma membrane.Replacing some critical cell metabolic processes, with (new) metabolic processes that bypassthe antibiotic’s (former) effect.Autophagy.Emission of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which inhibits oxidative stress.See also Cell, Pathogen, Pathogenic, Bacteria, Antibiotic, Plasma membrane, Enzyme, Penicillinases,Metabolism,  ABC  transporters,  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  Glycoprotein  remodeling,  Oxidativestress, Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), Autophagy.', 'Antibody': 'Also called immunoglobulin (Ig). A large defense protein that consists of two classes of polypeptidechains, light (L) chains and heavy (H) chains. A single antibody molecule consists of two identicalcopies of the L chain and two of the H chain. They are synthesized (i.e., made) by the immune system(B lymphocytes) of the organism. The antibody is composed of four proteins linked together to form aY-shaped bundle of proteins (looks somewhat like a slingshot or two hockey sticks taped together atthe handles). The amino acid sequence that makes up the stem (heavy chains or constant region) of theY  (i.e.,  the  handles  of  the  taped  together  hockey  sticks)  is  similar  for  all  antibodies.  The  stem  isknown as the Fc region of the antibody and it does not bind to antigen, but does have other regulatoryfunctions.The two arms of the Y are each made up of two side-by-side proteins called light chains and heavychains (i.e., proteins are chains of amino acids), with identical antigen-binding (ab) sites (known as“variable region”) on the tips of each “arm.” The antibody is thus bivalent in that it has two bindingsites for antigen. Taken together, the two arms of the Y are known as the Fab portions of the antibodymolecule. The Fab portions can be cleaved from the antibody molecule with papain (an enzyme that isalso  used  as  a  meat  tenderizer),  or  the  Fab  portions  can  be  produced  via  genetically  engineeredEscherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.When a foreign molecule (e.g., a bacterium, virus) enters the body, B lymphocytes are stimulatedinto becoming rapidly dividing blast cells, which mature into antibody-producing plasma cells. Theplasma cells are triggered by the foreign molecule’s epitope(s) (i.e., group or groups of specific atoms[also  known  as  a  hapten]  that  are  recognized  to  be  foreign  by  the  body’s  immune  system)  intoproducing antibody molecules possessing antigen-binding (ab) sites (also called combining sites ordeterminants).These fit into the foreign molecule’s epitope. Thus, via the tips of its arms, the antibody moleculebinds  specifically  to  the  foreign  entity  (antigen)  that  has  entered  the  body.  By  this  process,  itinactivates that foreign molecule or marks it for eventual destruction by other immune system cells.System marking of the foreign molecule (e.g., pathogen or toxin) for destruction is accomplished bythe fact that the stem of the Y (i.e., the Fc) fragment hangs free from the combined antibody–antigenclump, thereby providing a receptor for phagocytes, which roam throughout the body ingesting andsubsequently destroying such “marked” foreign molecules. This system is called “antibody-dependentcellular cytotoxicity.”Research published in 2001 indicates that antibodies may also kill some pathogens themselves bycatalyzing the formation of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen free radicals (singlet oxygen) and water.Hydrogen  peroxide  is  highly  reactive  and  could  potentially  kill  pathogens  when  generated  by  an(attached) antibody.There  are  five  classes  of  immunoglobulin:  IgG,  IgM,  IgD,  IgA,  and  IgE.

Since oxidationof lipids in the blood is the initial step in atherosclerosis, consumption of large amounts of certainantioxidants (e.g., flavonoids, melanoidins) may help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.Because excessive oxidation reactions within the body often lead to formation of tissue-damagingfree radicals (i.e., molecules containing an “extra” electron), consumption of applicable antioxidantscan help to prevent such tissue damage.Evidence indicates that tissue damage from free radicals may play a role in causing some arthritis,coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers.Synthetic  analogues  have  also  been  manufactured  (e.g.,  synthetic  vitamins),  which  perform  asimilar  antioxidant  function  to  naturally  occurring  antioxidant  phytochemicals.

For  example,  people  with  chronicmyelogenous leukemia (CML, also known as chronic myeloid leukemia) typically have 10–25 timesas many white blood cells as normal.Certain compounds can help restore/induce some cells’ apoptosis. For example, when ingested byhumans,  the  chemical  known  as  parthenolide  (extracted  from  the  herb  plant  known  as  feverfew)induces apoptosis in human leukemia stem cells (i.e., the progenitor cells from which all resultantleukemia  cells  in  that  body  would  be  “descended”).  In  2012,  Teri  W.  Odom  showed  that  certainaptamer-laden can penetrate the plasma membrane of cancer cells and restore the apoptosis pathwayto those cells.Research published by Duxin Sun and Max Wicha in 2010 indicated that when injected into mousecell culture, the chemical known as sulforaphane (extracted from cruciferous plants such as broccoli,cabbage,  kale) induces  apoptosis  in  mouse  breast  cancer  stem  cells  (i.e., the  progenitor  cells  fromwhich all resultant mouse breast cancer cells in that cell culture would be “descended”).Some  fruits  are  broken  down  in  the  human  digestive  system  to  yield  the  short  chain  fatty  acidknown as butyrate within the human colon. Butyrate can act via an epigenetic mechanism (i.e., histonemodification) to cause apoptosis of cancerous cells in the colon, thereby reducing the incidence ofhuman colon cancer.

The word “aptamer” is from the Latin aptus(“to fit”).In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for use as a pharmaceutical the aptamerMacugen™ (pegaptanib sodium), which is “pegylated” (i.e., joined with polyethylene glycol—PEG—to  camouflage  the  aptamer  molecule  from  the  body’s  immune  system  so  it  is  not  inactivated  byimmune response before it can do its work). Macugen™ binds to vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)  when  injected  into  eyeballs  of  people  who  are  suffering  from  “wet”  form  of  age-relatedmacular  degeneration  (AMD).  By  doing  so,  Macugen™  prevents  that  VEGF  from  causing  (more)growth of new blood vessels (i.e., in front of the retina) whose subsequent leakage of blood causesvision loss in AMD disease.In 1992, Louis Bock and John Toole isolated aptamers that bind and inhibit the blood-coagulationenzyme  “thrombin.”  Since  thrombin  is  crucial  to  the  formation  of  blood  clots  (coagulation),  suchaptamers  may  someday  be  useful  for  anticoagulant  therapy  (e.g.,  to  prevent  blood  clots  followingsurgery or heart attacks).One current use of aptamers is as capture agents (i.e.,  ligands  or  other  molecules  that  “bind”  toproteins,  which  are  attached  to  the  microarray  at  specific/known  locations).

In 1994, researchers succeeded in transferringgenes for polyhydroxylbutylate (PHB) (“biodegradable plastic”) production into A. thaliana. Becauseproduction of PHB requires simultaneous expression of three genes (i.e., the PHB production processis “polygenic”)—yet researchers have only been able to insert a maximum of two genes—they have toinsert two genes into one plant and one gene into a second plant and then finally get the (total) threegenes into (offspring) plants via traditional breeding.In 2001, Eduardo Blumwald and Hong-Xia Zhang inserted a salt tolerance gene from A.  thalianainto  a  tomato  (Lycopersicon  esculentum)  and  thereby  made  that  tomato  plant  resistant  to  salt  inconcentrations up to 200 mM (i.e., far higher than it could previously survive).

Those “tagged” protein molecules are said tohave been “ubiquitinated” or “ubiquitylated.”Upon the binding to it by an auxin molecule, that molecular complex (with auxin bound to its TIR1component) attaches ubiquitin molecules to a class of protein molecules known as Aux/IAA. BecauseAux/IAA normally represses plant genes that are triggered by auxins, this ubiquitination of Aux/IAAresults  in  their  removal  (for  recycling  elsewhere  in  the  cell)  and  thereby  activation  of  the  auxintriggered genes.

Itwas the result of a natural mutation that caused beta carotene to be produced in that cauliflower plantat a level that was approximately 100 times higher than normal for cauliflower.Beta carotene has been found to aid eyesight and to strengthen the immune system in people whoconsume it and may help prevent lung cancer and heart disease.Because  beta  carotene  is  processed  into  vitamin  A  by  the  human  body,  consumption  of  thisphytochemical  can  help  avoid  human  diseases  (e.g.,  in  developing  countries  where  vitamin  A  isscarce) that result from deficiency of vitamin A, for example,Coronary heart diseaseCertain cancers (e.g., cancer of prostrate, lungs)Childhood blindnessAge-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in older peopleVarious childhood diseases that often result in death, due to weakened immune systemSee  also  Vitamin,  Golden  rice,  Aflatoxin,  Fungus,  OH43,  Phytochemicals,  Nutraceuticals,Carotenoids, Cancer, Coronary heart disease (CHD), Antioxidants, AMD, Desaturase.', 'Beta Cells': 'Insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Examples  include  Bifidobacterium  bifidum,  Bifidobacterium  longum,  Bifidobacteriuminfantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium acidophilus. In general, Bifidus bacteriahelp to promote good health of the host animals by several means:They  produce  organic  acids  (e.g.,  propionic,  acetic,  lactic),  which  make  the  host  animal’sdigestive system more acidic. Because most pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms)grow best at a neutral pH (i.e., neither acidic nor base/caustic), the growth rates of pathogensare thereby inhibited.They  “crowd  out”  enteric  pathogens,  since  Bifidus  bacteria  grow  fast  in  the  acidicenvironment created by those organic acids.Some  of  the  organic  acids  (e.g.,  propionic)  produced  by  Bifidus  bacteria  are  able  to  passthrough  the  outer  cell  membrane  of  pathogenic  bacteria  and  fungi.  Once  inside  thosepathogens’ cells, these acids dissociate and acidify the cell interior (which disrupts proteinsynthesis, growth, and replication of that pathogen).They  produce  bacteriocins,  which  are  proteins  that  suppress  growth  of  the  pathogenicbacteria.They produce certain short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed by the host animal (e.g., inthe colon) and thereby result in a reduction of triglyceride (fat) levels in the host animal’sbloodstream.

During the 1990s, this term also became commonly used to refer to various “laboratories on achip” (e.g., to analyze very small samples of DNA, to assess the impact of pharmaceuticals—or pharmaceutical drug candidate molecules—on specific cells [i.e., attached to the biochip’ssurface] or on specific cellular receptors [ligand–receptor response of a cell], to size and sortDNA fragments [genes] via the [proportional] fluorescence of dyes intercalated in the DNAmolecules, to detect the presence of a specific DNA fragment [gene] via hybridization to aprobe [which was fabricated onto the “chip”], to size and sort protein molecules [via variouscells fabricated onto “chip”], to assess pharmaceuticals via adhesion molecules attached to a“chip,” to detect specific pathogens or cancerous cells in a blood sample [e.g., by applyingcontrolled  electrical  fields  to  cause  those  cells  to  collect  at  electrodes  on  the  “chip”],  toscreen  for  compounds  that  act  against  a  disease  [e.g.,  by  applying  antibodies  linked  tofluorescent molecules and then measuring electronically the fluorescence that is triggered byantibody  binding],  to  conduct  gene  expression  analysis  by  measuring  fluorescence  ofmessenger  RNA  [specific  to  which  particular  gene  is  “turned  on”]  when  that  mRNAhybridizes with DNA [from genome] on the hybridization surface of a chip).2.  Shortly  after  the  1990s,  several  companies  began  manufacturing  “biochips”  capable  ofsequencing (i.e., determining the sequence of) DNA samples. Such biochips have—attachedto their surfaces—all possible “DNA probes” (i.e., short sequences of DNA). The sample (i.e.,the unknown DNA molecule) is passed over the probe-covered surface of the biochip, whereeach  relevant  segment  (within  the  large  unknown  DNA  molecule)  hybridizes  with  (i.e.,“pairs” with) the short “DNA probe” attached to a known location on the surface of the biochip. Because the sequence of each DNA probe—at each specified location on the biochip—isknown,  that  information  (i.e.,  the  probes’  sequences  that  the  unknown  DNA  moleculehybridized  to)  is  then  utilized  to  “assemble  the  complete  sequence”  of  the  unknown  DNAmolecule.3.

Forexample, the microorganisms within the “bottom” layer might specifically differentiate/change in amanner that enables them to better adhere the entire biofilm onto underlying substrate.For example, Streptococcus mutans bacteria can form a biofilm on the surface of teeth. Biofilms areoften responsible for a large number of human diseases and can sometimes help pathogenic bacteria tobe  resistant  to  antibiotics,  because  it  is  difficult  for  antibiotics  to  penetrate  the  biofilm.Approximately 80% of human pathogenic bacteria form biofilms during at least one part of their lifecycle.Sometimes, the microorganisms that constitute a biofilm will act collectively to do something (e.g.,“turning  on”  one  or  more  pathways  for  production  of  specific  chemical  product(s)  from  certainsubstrate(s)). When “enough” of that species of microorganism are present, as determined via quorumsensing, those microorganisms collectively turn on a pathway for the production of a product (e.g., atoxin, in the case of cholera disease).During 2009, Erik Taylor and Thomas Webster discovered that specific nanoparticles (i.e., made ofiron oxide with an average diameter of 8 nm) would penetrate and kill the Staphylococcus epidermidisbacteria within a biofilm constructed by those bacteria on the surface of a man-made medical implantin  the  body.

One rapid test for bacteria uses two chemical reagents that firstbreak down bacteria cell membranes and then cause the ATP from those broken cells to luminesce.Another rapid test uses electrophoresis to first separate the sequences of bacteria’s DNA (following itsextraction from cell and enzymatic fragmentation), causing those separated sequences to luminesce,and then a camera is used to record the sequence-pattern light emission and compare that pattern topatterns  of pathogenic  bacteria previously stored in  a database.

Such coated nanotubes are placedinto a tiny (permeable to glucose) dialysis capillary tube whose ends are then sealed. Whenthat capillary tube is inserted beneath the skin—for example, of a person with diabetes, andsubsequently illuminated with near-infrared light (which can pass through human tissue)—those  carbon  nanotubes  fluoresce  in  a  specific  manner  that  is  directly  dependent  on  theglucose concentration (i.e., telling the diabetic when he needs to inject his insulin). That isbecause his body’s glucose enters the semipermeable capillary; the glucose oxidase (enzyme)acts  on  the  glucose  to  produce  hydrogen  peroxide,  which  then  complexes  with  theferricyanide in a way that changes the fluorescence properties of the nanotubes in a mannerthat is directly dependent on the concentration of glucose.Nanosheets of peptoids onto which have been attached biologically active ligands (e.g., whichresult in one or more types of signal being generated when those ligands bind to the specificmolecule sought).A  one-part  test  that  can  detect  specific  DNA  segments  in  complex  (“dirty,”  multiplecomponent) samples.

This  wasbecause oil produced from rapeseed grown prior to 1971 contained 30%–60% erucic acid.By 1974, canola varieties producing oil containing less than 5% erucic acid constituted virtually allof  that  year’s  Canadian  rapeseed  crop,  and  Canadian  breeders  continued  to  develop  new  canolavarieties with ever-lower erucic acid content (e.g., oil from double-zero canola varieties contains lessthan 0.1% erucic acid).In 1982, Canada filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to have low-erucic-acidrapeseed (LEAR) oil affirmed to be Generally Recognized As Safe, which the FDA did. LEAR wasone of the first foodstuffs to be determined to be substantially equivalent under the OECD-definedcriteria for substantial equivalence because LEAR was shown (in OECD petition) to be very similarto,  and  composed  of  the  same  basic  components  as,  traditional  rapeseed  oil  (and  other  commonlyconsumed vegetable oils) except for a lower level of erucic acid (the component of earlier concernearlier).In 2002, a Brassica juncea canola variety was introduced for the first time ever in Canada. Genomicdifferences among the three species sometimes result in certain diseases causing more damage in onecanola species than the other. For example, the fungal disease Alternaria black spot tends to causemore damage in juncea or rapa canola varieties than in napus canola varieties. For example, fungalAlbugo candida staghead disease tends to cause more damage in rapa canola varieties than in napus orjuncea canola varieties.Because it is a Brassica plant, canola also produces sulfur-based gases (a natural defense againstcertain fungi, nematodes, and insect pests).

Monosaccharides are called “simple sugars,”of which the most abundant is D-glucose. It is both the major fuel for most organisms and constitutesthe basic building block of the most abundant polysaccharides, such as starch and cellulose.While starch is a fuel source, cellulose is the primary structural material of plants. Carbohydratesare produced by photosynthesis in plants. Most, but not all, carbohydrates are represented chemicallyby  the  formula  Cx(H2O)n,  where  n  is  3  or  higher.  On  the  basis  of  their  chemical  structures,carbohydrates are classified as polyhydroxy aldehydes, polyhydroxy ketones, and their derivatives.The term carbohydrates was originally utilized to apply to any compounds (i.e., saccharides) whosemolecular formula could be written in a form implying an equal number of moles of carbon and water.See also Glucose (GLc), Glycogen, Monosaccharides, Oligosaccharides, Polysaccharides, Sialic acid,C4 photosynthesis, Mole.', 'Carbon Nanohorns': 'Refers to tiny tubes composed of carbon that are closed off on one end via a cone-shaped cap, whosediameter is measured in nanometers.Groups of carbon nanohorns self-assemble into spherical structures with the capped (i.e., horn) endspointing outward in all directions. These spherical nanohorn structures have a diameter of less than100 nm, so are able to penetrate the plasma membrane (i.e., outer skin) of cells, but not the nucleus ofcells.When certain natural polysaccharides or gum arabic is applied to the surfaces of carbon nanohorns,these  nanohorn  structures  can  subsequently  be  utilized  to  carry  certain  pharmaceutical  compoundsinto cells. This can be a means to carry specific pharmaceuticals into cells, which would otherwise notpenetrate  the  plasma  membrane  of  the  (diseased)  cells.

Thereare  several  potential  applications  for  the  utilization  of  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs)  within  fields  ofnanobiotechnology.For example, during 2003, Bruce J. Hinds and coworkers were able to incorporate numerous CNTsinto  a  polymer  membrane  (film)  in  a  manner  such  that  the  CNTs  served  as  pores  through  whichmolecules possessing 1–10 nm diameters could pass from one side of the membrane to the other. Suchnanotube  membranes  hold  significant  potential  utility  as  molecular  sieves  (e.g.,  to  screen  certainbiochemicals out of solution/mixture), as the contact surface for certain bio-sensors (e.g., allowing-inonly the molecules sought to be sensed).During 2009, Stuart Lindsay and colleagues utilized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) toconstruct a nanopore sequencer.During 2012, Marshall, Brown, and Jimmy Xu synthesized carbon nanotubes that have a diameterof  approximately  40  nm  (i.e.,  large  enough  to  carry  anticancer  drug  molecules  suspended  in  atemperature-sensitive hydrogel). After injecting these carbon nano-tubes and waiting for them to betaken  up  by  tumor  cells,  an  alternating  magnetic  field  was  applied  (external  to  the  body),  whichinduced an alternating electric current within the nanotubes. The nanotubes’ electrical resistance tothat  current  generated  heat  that  liquefied  the  hydrogel,  thereby  releasing  the  drugs  into  the  tumorcells.During 2004, Hongjie Dai and Paul A. Wender utilized single-walled carbon nanotubes to ferry-specific proteins (e.g., streptavidin) across the plasma membrane of certain cells, where the proteinwas  able  to  then  act  upon  the  cell’s  interior.  Dai  and  Wender  showed  that  those  specific  proteins(bound to biotin-coated carbon nano-tubes) entered the cells via endocytosis.Certain  carbon  nanotubes  can  form  into  bundles  that  rotate  (spin)  rapidly  in  the  presence  of  arotating  magnetic  field.  Via  precise  manipulation  of  that  magnetic  field,  these  nanodrills  could  beutilized to drill into specific cells (e.g., cancer cells) inside the body to deliver drugs into those cancercells or to kill them outright.Some carbon nanotubes can also act as an antenna to receive electromagnetic radiation possessingwavelengths of several hundred nanometers length (i.e., visible light). That visible light’s energy isconverted by the carbon nanotubes into either electricity or thermal energy (i.e., to drive a chemicalreaction in adjacent substrate). Thus, these carbon nanotubes may be utilized in the future to constructlight-sensing biosensors.Some single-walled carbon nanotubes are fluorophores.

The carotenes and thexanthophylls, orange to yellow in color, are the most common. Carotenoids are responsible for thecoloration of certain plants (e.g., the carrot) and of some animals (e.g., the lobster).

Carotenoids  are  composed  ofisoprene units (usually eight) that may be modified by the addition of other chemical groups on themolecule.

People possessing the relevant genes (especially common in Italians and people descendedfrom Italians) are unable to tolerate gluten (a component of cereal grains) or gluten-similar proteins(secalin and hordein) in rye and barley. Consumption of gluten (e.g., in wheat-containing products)causes villi (small fingerlike projections on the surface of the inner wall of the small intestine) tobecome chronically inflamed. An enzyme named tissue transglutaminase is released by the damagedcells (enterocytes). In genetically susceptible individuals, the B cells of the immune system make andrelease antibodies against the tissue transglutaminase. When those antibodies encounter molecules oftissue  transglutaminase  on  the  surfaces  of  villi,  they  can  cause  degeneration  of  villi  in  the  smallintestine and thereby result in a reduction in the body’s subsequent ability to absorb nutrients fromfoods. In severe cases, this may result in malnutrition occurring while an otherwise adequate diet islater consumed.Tissue transglutaminase can also modify undigested gluten (peptides) present in the small intestine,thereby enabling the gluten to tightly bind to certain histocompatibilty leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2and HLA-DQ8).

Certain organisms may consist of only one cell, such asyeast  or  protein  bacteria,  protozoa,  some  algae,  and  gametes  (the  reproductive  stages)  of  higherorganisms. Larger organisms are subdivided into organs that are relatively autonomous but cooperatein  the  functioning  of  that  plant  or  animal.  Unicellular  (i.e.,  single-cell)  organisms  perform  all  lifefunctions within the one cell.In a higher organism (i.e., a multicellular organism), entire populations of cells (i.e., an organ) maybe designated a particular specialized task (e.g., the heart to facilitate circulation). The cells of muscletissue are specialized for movement and those of bone and connective tissue, for structural support.The surface of some cells bear extensions (e.g., extended “arms”). For example, such extensionsfrom the bone cells known as osteocytes are called “dendrites.”While most cells are too small to be seen with the unaided eye, the egg yolk of birds is a single cell,so the egg yolk of an ostrich is the world’s largest cell.

For example, in 1952 AaronMoscona observed that (harvesting enzyme-separated) chicken embryo cells did not remain separatedbut  instead  coalesced  again  into  an  (embryo)  aggregate.  In  1955,  Philip  Townes  and  JohannesHoltfreter  showed  that  “like”  amphibian  (e.g.,  frog)  neuron  cells  will  rejoin  together  after  beingphysically separated (e.g., with a knife blade); but “unlike” cells remain segregated (apart).Cell adhesion proteins per se were formally discovered by Gerald M. Edelman during the 1970s.Adhesion  proteins  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  guiding  monocytes  to  sources  of  infection  (e.g.,pathogens)  because  adhesion  molecules  in  the  walls  of  blood  vessels  (after  activation  caused  bypathogen  invasion  of  adjacent  tissue)  adhere  to  like  adhesion  molecules  in  the  membranes  ofmonocytes in the blood. The monocytes pass through the blood vessel walls, become macrophages,and  fight  the  pathogen  infection  (e.g.,  triggering  tissue  inflammation).  When  certain  cell  adhesionproteins  are  absent  from  tissues  (where  they  are  normally  present),  it  can  lead  to  cancers  of  theendometrium, bladder, prostate, skin, breast, pancreas, colon, etc.See  also  Monocytes,  Macrophage,  Polypeptide  (protein),  Cell,  Pathogen,  CD4  protein,  CD44protein,  GP120  protein,  Vaginosis,  Harvesting  enzymes,  Harvesting,  Signal  transduction,  Selectins,Lectins,  Glycoproteins,  Sugar  molecules,  Leukocytes,  Lymphocytes,  Neutrophils,  Endothelium,Endothelial cells, P-selectin, ELAM-1, Integrins, Cytokines, Cancer, Chronic inflammation.', 'Cell Culture': 'The in  vitro  (i.e.,  outside  of  body,  in  a  test  tube  or  vat)  propagation  of  cells  isolated  from  livingorganisms.

In humans,the various blood cell types (e.g., red blood cells, white blood cells) differentiate from stem cells inthe bone marrow.

That signal causessome of the endothelial smooth muscle cells to “transform” from contractile phenotype (i.e., normalstate, in which they help to control blood pressure) to synthetic phenotype (i.e., which can move). Thecells in synthetic state move to the site of the injury, where they repair it via growing/dividing, andthen they return to the contractile state.During metastasis, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) exuded by a cancerous tumor causesepithelial  cells  to  “transform”  to  a  mesenchymal  phenotype  (thereby  enabling  subsequent  cellmotility).The molecule n-cofilin plays a critical role in the body’s regulation of cell motility (e.g., helps tobreak  down  actin  fibers,  resulting  in  cells  moving  during  development).

Environmentalfactors  impacting  gene  expression  include  temperature,  sunlight,  humidity,  consumption  of  somevitamins, industrial chemicals, the presence of certain bacteria, the presence of signal transducers andactivators of transcription (STATs), etc.In  addition,  epigenetics  cause  organisms  to  preferentially  express  certain  alleles  (e.g.,  thoseinherited from the mother or from the father). For example, in mice, more maternal-origin alleles areexpressed within the developing brain, and more paternal-origin alleles are expressed within the adultmouse  brain  than  would  occur  from  a  simple  random  50/50  contribution  of  parental  alleles  to  theoffspring’s DNA.For example, the eggs of the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus)  yield  a larger  fraction  ofmale offspring when those eggs are incubated in the nest (made of rotting vegetation) at temperaturesabove 90°F (32°C) than when those eggs are incubated at temperatures below 90°F (32°C).Recent  research  indicates  that  physical  exercise  changes  the  expression  levels  of  some  genes(within human skeletal muscles) involved in the body’s metabolism of carbohydrates.That (central dogma) restatement also expressly includes the fact that more than one protein canresult from each gene in an organism’s genome (e.g., due to interactions between genes, interactionsbetween genes and their protein products [e.g., STATs], interactions between genes and histones, andinteractions  between  genes  and  some  environmental  factors).  Mechanistically,  this  results  in(different) proteins via the following:Alternative splicing of the mRNA transcript. For example, the COX-3 enzyme is produced inthe human body when intron 1 is retained in the mRNA transcript during transcription of theCOX-1 gene.

This phenomenon was first described by Louis Pasteur. “Chiral” isa word derived from the Greek cheir (meaning “hand”).For example, human hands may be used to illustrate chirality in that when the left and right handare held one on top of the other, one thumb sticks out on one side while the other thumb sticks out onthe other side. The point is that the same number and type of fingers and thumbs exist in both hands,but their arrangement in space may be different. So it is with the arrangement of a given molecule’s(e.g., a drug’s) atoms in 3D space. The two are designated as “R” for right-handed and “S” for lefthanded (S is from the Latin “sinistro”).Approximately  40%  of  drugs  on  the  market  today  consist  of  chiral  compounds.  In  many  chiraldrugs,  only  one  type  of  the  molecule  is  beneficially  biologically  active  (i.e.,  acts  beneficially  tocontrol disease, reduce pain, etc.), while the other type of the drug molecule is either inactive or elsecauses undesired impacts (called “side effects” of the drug mixture).

Inappearance, they are sort of like two rolls of carpeting standing side by side that are tied together withrope at their middles.These  (recently  replicated)  cylinders  (that  are  joined  at  their  middles)  are  homologouschromosomes (i.e., the genes of the two chromosomes are linked in the same linear order within theDNA  strands  of  both  chromosomes).  While  they  are  still  joined  at  their  middles,  these  pairedchromosomes appear X-shaped when photographed by a karyotyper to produce a karyotype.Chromatin is usually not visible during the interphase of a cell but can be made more visible duringall phases by reaction with basic stains (dyes) specific for DNA.Chromatin modification is a term that refers to any (epigenetic) change in a cell’s chromatin thatimpacts  how  (or  if)  a  given  gene  is  expressed.

Although  those  reactive  chemicals  are  intended  to  kill  invadingpathogens  during  an  infection,  their  chronic  release  by  neutrophils/macrophages  (e.g.,  after  aninfection is over, or as a result of plaque deposition on walls of blood vessels) can harm body tissuesby causing inflamed blood vessel linings, swollen joints, and damaged DNA (potentially leading tocertain cancers such as breast cancer).In people who have an applicable cancer, their body often over-produces interleukin-6 (IL-6) (i.e., acytokine  that  normally  stimulates  several  different  types  of  immune  system  cells  in  response  toinfections or injuries) because those cancerous cells cause decreased presence of the protein known asSOCS3.  SOCS3  is  present  in  normal  cells,  where  it  functions  as  an  off-switch  in  a  feedback  loopinvolving  the  IL-6,  thereby  normally  halting  that  inflammation  promoter  after  IL-6’s  work  (e.g.,combatting the infection) is completed.

For example, 70%of  the  agricultural  land  in  the  country  of  Colombia  possesses  harmful  amounts/conditions  ofaluminum to damage crops.Corn (maize) yields are reduced up to 80% by such aluminum in soils. Soybeans, cotton, and fieldbean yields are also reduced.

Barry  Sharpless,  it  is  a  category  of  chemistry  (e.g.,  a  family  of  related  chemicalreactions)  that  utilizes  heteroatom  links  to  hook  together  specific  molecular  units  (modules)  intolonger molecular structures, in a modular manner.Click chemistry can be utilized to attach fluorescent labels (i.e., molecular units that fluoresce whenilluminated  by  light  of  applicable  wavelength)  to  the  surface  of  living  cells.  That  facilitatessubsequent imaging of those cells by scientists who are investigating functions of cells.Click chemistry can be utilized to make certain small molecule modules capable of passing throughthe  blood–brain  barrier  (BBB)  that  Matthew  Disney  and  colleagues  developed  in  2014  to  bind  toadjacent portions of the RNA defect known as a “tetranucleotide repeat” in which a series of fournucleotides is repeated more times than normal within an individual’s genetic code. When that tetranucleotide repeat causes applicable RNA splicing abnormalities, it results in the progressive muscleweakening disease known as myo-tonic dystrophy type 2. However, via this use of click chemistry, theDisney-created small molecule modules are able to pass through the BBB, bind to the defective RNA,and thereby reverse the effect of the disease.Click chemistry can be utilized to attach a targeting molecule (e.g., folic acid) onto a nanoparticle(e.g., nanocapsules, nanoshells) that has been filled with an applicable pharmaceutical (e.g., tumornecrosis factor). Because many cancerous tumors consume very large amounts of folic acid duringtheir rapid growth, folic acid can be utilized as a targeting molecule (e.g., attached to the surface ofsuch therapeutic nanoparticles) to deliver the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) directly to the tumor. TheTNF can then act to disrupt formation of the new vasculature (blood vessels) needed by the tumor forblood  supply.

As a result, membersof a clone have identical genetic compositions.For example, many plants reproduce asexually (i.e., without sex) via a process known as apomixis.For example, man has reproduced numerous trees via grafting of a branch from a valuable tree intoa  less-valuable  tree  (which  subsequently  provides  nutrients,  etc.  to  that  ingrafted  branch  so  it  cancontinue  to  grow,  flower, and  reproduce).  Via  such  grafting,  every navel  (seedless)  orange  tree  onEarth is an exact genetic copy of one bud mutation that occurred in 1820 on a sour orange tree inBahia, Brazil.Protozoa, bacteria, and some animals (e.g., the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima) can reproduceasexually  (i.e.,  without  sex)  by  a  process  called  “binary  fission.”  In  binary  fission  a  single-celledorganism undergoes cell division. The result is two cells with identical genetic composition. Whenthese two identical cells undergo division, the result is four cells with identical genetic composition.These identical offspring are all members of a clone. The word “clone” may be used either as a nounor a verb.Scientists have cloned some adult mammals via nuclear transfer.

The amount of such proteins produced within their bodies is proportional to theseverity and duration of the cold experienced.For example, prior to cold hardening, Culicoides variipennis insects usually die after exposure for 2h to a temperature of 14°F (−10°C). If those insects are first exposed for 1 h to a temperature of 41°F(5°C), approximately 98% of these insects can then survive exposure for 3 days to a temperature of14°F (−10°C).In  certain  plants,  such  exposure  to  cold  causes  oxidative  stress.

Houghten developed a technique for the creation of peptide libraries in small mesh “bags”by solid-phase parallel synthesis, thereby enabling automation of the process (in the early 1990s).For a library that is used for new drug (candidate) screening, high diversity in molecular structureamong the chemicals in the library is desired, to increase the efficiency of the screening process.

Because these two types of cancer cells possess IL-2receptors  on  their  surfaces,  the  IL-2  (targeting  function)  binds  to  that  receptor  and  isinternalized by the cell.The diphtheria toxin (killing function) then shuts down protein synthesis within the cancercells.It then kills the cancerous cells.This type of approach is widespread and there are many different types of this category of conjugate.Another type of conjugate consists of enzymes used in the treatment of certain molecular diseasesattached covalently to polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this case, the PEG greatly diminishes both theimmunogenicity (the tendency to induce the body’s immune reaction) and the antigenicity (the abilityto react with preformed antibodies).Another type of conjugate consists of various molecules (e.g., fluorophores, toxins) or nanoparticles(e.g., quantum dots) attached to antibodies.

However, that natural level (3–7 mg/g of fat) is too small to exertmuch  beneficial  impact.  Feeding  of  soybean  oil  (in  feed  rations)  to  livestock  has  been  proven  toincrease CLA content in the resultant meat. In 1998, T.R. Dhiman showed that feeding of soybean oil(i.e., whole) to dairy cattle did also increase the content of CLA in their milk.Research conducted during the 1990s indicated that consumption of CLA (e.g., by humans, swine,rats) causes the bodies of those animals to change the way they utilize and store energy. Thus, thebody requires less food to perform at the same level. The body also tends to produce less body fat(adipose  tissue)  and  more  lean  protein  (e.g.,  muscle)  tissue.

It prefersto lay its eggs on soybean plants instead of corn plants. During 2007, James Baum et al. showed thatRNA interference (RNAi) could potentially be utilized to control this insect pest via double-strandedRNA (dsRNA) via oral delivery to the larvae (e.g., via corn plant tissues genetically engineered tocontain relevant dsRNA). The relevant dsRNA is taken up by the larvae’s midgut cells and processedby its cells’ native RNAi machinery, which leads to specific knockdown of the applicable mRNA (e.g.,targeted mRNA that encodes a protein required for an essential function in the insect’s cells).Other genetic variants of the corn rootworm include the “Northern phenotype” or Northern cornrootworm (Diabrotica barberi) and the Mexican corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera zeae).

It  was  latershown to also be present within archaea.Bacteria  and  archaea  utilize  CRISPR  in  combination  with  Cas  proteins  (i.e.,  CRISPR-associatedproteins)  known  as  Cas1  and  Cas2  to  silence  crucial  segments  of  an  invading  infectious  agent’sgenetic element content via a mechanism analogous to RNA interference and also to thereby retainimmunity against invasion by that same infectious agent in the future. The latter is accomplished via amolecular  complex  (Cas1–Cas2)  that  can  latch  onto  a  specific  segment  of  an  invader’s  geneticcontent, copy it as DNA segment, and then insert that DNA segment into the bacteria’s (or archaea’s)DNA in the form of a spacer (which functions as an immune system memory to facilitate a swifter andstronger  response  to that  particular  invader next time).  When,  for  example,  a  later-invading virus’DNA binds to such CRISPR segments in the bacteria’s DNA, the Cas9 enzyme cuts up that viral DNA(thereby halting the viral invasion).After initially being called other things, it was renamed CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas in 2002.

The code is made up of subunits, called nucleic acids. The sequence of the four nucleic acidsis  interpreted  by  certain  molecular  machines  (systems)  to  produce  the  proteins  required  by  anorganism.The structure of the DNA molecule was elucidated in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, andMaurice Wilkins. The DNA molecule is a linear polymer made up of deoxyribonucleotide repeatingunits (composed of the sugar 2-deoxyribose, phosphate, and a purine or pyrimidine base). The basesare linked by a phosphate group, joining the 3′ position of one sugar to the 5′ position of the nextsugar. Most molecules are double stranded and antiparallel, resulting in a right-handed helix structurethat is held together by hydrogen bonds between a purine on one chain and pyrimidine on the otherchain.  DNA  is  the  carrier  of  genetic  information,  which  is  encoded  in  the  sequence  of  bases;  it  ispresent  in  chromosomes  and  chromosomal  material  of  cell  organelles  such  as  mitochondria  andchloroplasts  and  also  present  in  some  viruses.

DNAmethylation is used by healthy cells to perform the following:“Turn off” certain genes when those particular genes are not needed (e.g., they turn off genesinvolved in juvenile development after the organism reaches adulthood).Preferentially  express  certain  alleles  (e.g.,  those  inherited  from  the  mother  or  from  thefather).  For  example,  in  mice,  more  maternal-origin  alleles  are  expressed  within  thedeveloping brain and more paternal-origin alleles are expressed within the adult mouse brainthan  would  occur  from  a  simple  random  50/50  contribution  of  parental  alleles  to  theoffspring’s DNA.Stabilize  genome/prevent  the  spread/activation  of  potentially  harmful  nucleic  acids  (e.g.,certain  transposable  elements)  within  the  organism’s  genome.  For  example,  the  mousepigment gene known as agouti can be rendered defective when a certain transposable elementembeds itself in that gene’s nearby regulatory sequence, resulting in yellow or mottled mousefur, which is less effective in camouflaging the mouse from predators.Enable  some  genomes  to  render  their  organism  more  adaptive  to  its  environment.  Forexample,  the  black  truffle  fungi  (Tuber  melanosporum),  whose  genome  consists  ofapproximately  58%  “jumping  genes”  (also  known  as  transposable  genetic  elements,  ortransposons), utilize reversible DNA methylation to “turn on” and “turn off” the transposablegenetic elements as needed due to changes in its environment.Inactivate X chromosome (required in humans and some other species for creation of males).DNA  methylation  causes  inbreeding  depression  (i.e.,  offspring  resulting  from  the  mating  of  twoclosely related individuals are less fit and less fertile than offspring from mating of individuals whoare not closely related). DNA methylation can be impacted by environmental factors including diet,exercise, and stress. DNA methylation (e.g., of tumor suppressor genes that would normally preventinappropriate cell division/proliferation) also occurs in some cancers.The specific DNA methylation resulting from the addition of a methyl group to the particular DNAbase cysteine is vital to the regulation of many cellular processes such as embryonic development,gene transcription, and the cell’s chromatin structure.Some  DNA  methylations  are  reversible  and  can  impact  an  organism’s  behavior.  For  example,during the lifetime of honeybees (Apis mellifera  L.),  specific  patterns  of  DNA  methylation  in  155genes found within their brain cells determine which individuals become nurse bees (who feed andclean bee larvae) versus forager bees (who travel out from hive to find and bring back nectar fromflowers). If there is a sudden shortage of nurse bees in the hive, some of the forager bees will revert tobecome nurse bees via changes in the methylation patterns of 57 of those 155 genes.Some  DNA  methylations  (e.g.,  accomplished  via  feeding  of  a  small  amount  of  a  methyl  groupdonor compound such as folic acid) can correct certain genetic defects. For example, feeding of folicacid to pregnant mice from a line bearing the earlier-described defective agouti gene typically resultsin at least half of her off-spring having normal brown color fur (making them more likely to remainhidden  from  predators).

This has involved selecting for those with extremelow  epidermal  (leaf)  water  conductance,  moderate  osmotic  adjustment  and  low  criticalrelative water content.Breeding  for  the  SLOW  WILTING  trait  (in which higher  ascorbic content  of leaf  stomatacells results in them closing faster in times of water stress to minimize leaf water loss).Breeding  for  increased  pinitol  (a  cyclic-molecule  carbohydrate)  content  in  leaves,  whichenables photosynthesis activity to continue longer during times of drought stress.In some plants such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), their cyto-chrome P450 molecules can help themto respond to certain kinds of stress (e.g., drought) if those cytochrome P450 molecules are present inhigh enough abundance.Another possibility is the use of genetic engineering to activate a plant’s CBF/DREB1 pathway,ABA pathway, etc. See also Trait, Gene, Promoter, Protein, Enzyme, Polygenic, Genetic engineering,Corn,  Trehalose,  Drought  tolerance,  CBF/DREB1  pathway,  Cytochrome  P450,  Abscisic  acid,  cspBgene, Stomatal pores, Ion channels, PARP, PARP inhibitors, ERU maps, Abiotic stresses, Ethylene,Senescence.', 'DSB': 'Acronym for double-strand breaks.

Initially a repressor protein is bound to a specificregion  of  DNA.  This  binding  inhibits  transcription  to  mRNA,  thus  blocking  the  synthesis  of  theprotein (enzyme) specified by the mRNA. When present, the inducer molecule binds to the repressorprotein and inactivates it. Thus, the inhibition caused by the repressor protein is overcome and mRNAcan be synthesized, which consequently leads to synthesis of the mRNA-specified protein (enzyme).The  word  derepression  is  sometimes  used  because  the  repressor  protein  is,  by  itself,  active  inrepressing protein (enzyme) synthesis. Its repressive action is mitigated (dere-pressed) by the inducermolecule. Hence, derepression (or unrepression) of repression equals induction.

While  the  actual  gene/DNA  sequences  (genetic  information)  constitute  the“blueprint”  for  the  synthesis  of  all  the  proteins  needed  by  a  living  organism,  the  epigeneticmechanism  (epigenetic  information)  provides  the  “instructions”  to  cell  via  when,  where,  and  how(much) that genetic information is utilized (expressed). The epigenetic mechanism (epigenome) canalso be impacted by environmental factors including diet, exercise, and stress.Coined  from  the  Greek  epi  meaning  “upon”  by  Conrad  H.  Waddington  in  the  1940s,  this  termessentially means “above the genome” or “on top of the genome,” but more broadly refers to all of the“nonclassical genetic/heredity” sources of a given organism’s phenotype. Examples are as follows:As  a  female  mammal  embryo  (including  humans)  develops,  epigenetics  causes  randominactivation of one X chromosome.Preferential expression of certain alleles (e.g., those inherited from the mother or from thefather). In mice, more maternal-origin alleles are expressed within the developing brain andmore  paternal-origin  alleles  are  expressed  within  the  adult  mouse  brain,  than  would  occurfrom a simple random 50/50 contribution of parental alleles to the offspring’s DNA.As a plant embryo develops into a seedling (juvenile in the case of an animal), different genesare expressed (or silenced) in that organism, analogous to mammal embryo development. Forexample, during 2002, researchers discovered that feeding small amounts of methionine, folicacid,  zinc,  betaine,  choline,  and  vitamin  B12  to  certain  pregnant  inbred  (yellow-colored)laboratory  mice  will  cause  their  offspring  to  have  brown-colored  fur  via  an  epi-geneticchange caused by DNA methylation because the folic acid donates methyl molecular groupsto the mouse’s chromatin, thereby silencing the applicable gene (known as “agouti” gene).When epigenetic change results from consumption of certain foods/compounds, it is referredto as “nutritional epigenetics.”As a result of certain disease(s) afflicting the organism, different genes within the organism’sDNA are silenced (or expressed). For example, hypoxia (e.g., resulting during tuberculosis orcertain cancers) has been shown to result in epigenetic events within the bodies of relevantpatients. When it results from cancer, it is referred to as “cancer epigenetics.”As an organism (especially during its embryo stage) interacts with its environment, some ofthose  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  temperature)  cause  certain  genes  to  be  expressed  (orsilenced). For example, in the mouse-ear cress plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), a gene known as“FLC” normally represses flowering. However, exposure of that plant to prolonged cold willepigenetically  silence  that  gene  (thereby  enabling  flowering  to  begin  when  spring’s  warmweather arrives). For example, the eggs of the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) yielda larger fraction of male offspring when those eggs are incubated (in the nest) at temperaturesabove 90°F (32°C) than when those eggs are incubated at temperatures below 90°F (32°C).As  an  organism  passes  from  juvenile  stage  to  later  life  stage(s).  For  example,  the  femalehoneybee  (Apis  mellifera)  “switches  on”/off  approximately  40%  of  her  total  genes  as  shematures from being a “nurse bee” (taking care of pupae while she is a juvenile) to being a“forager bee.” During times in which the honeybee colony is in need of more forager bees(i.e., adults), the juveniles mature faster (to “forager bees”) than during normal times.Epigenetic  events  include  impacts  of  microRNAs,  short  interfering  RNA  (siRNA),  gene  silencing,DNA  methylation,  histone  methylation,  DNA/histone  acetylation,  DNA/histone  phosphorylation,DNA/histone  ubiquitination,  histone  biotinylation,  chromatin  remodeling,  chromatin  modification,histone modification, paramutation, nucleolar dominance, and gene imprinting.At least one type of epigenetic regulation is caused by changes in the (molecular-scale) shape of anorganism’s  chromatin.  Such  “chromatin  remodeling”  can  be  caused  by  introduction  (into  cell)  ofcertain siRNA, certain transcription activators, certain short-chain fatty acids, etc.Some  epigenetic  changes  are  heritable.  For  example,  research  indicates  that  a  girl  infant  whoexperiences “famine” in the womb (i.e., her mother endures near starvation while pregnant) is muchmore  likely  to  bear  grandchildren  who  live  shorter-than-average  life  spans  and  both  children  andgrandchildren who become diabetic when they are adults.For  example,  if  a  male  arachnid  known  as  the  pseudoscorpion  (Cordylochernes  scorpioides)  isexposed to the antibiotic tetracycline, both it and its male offspring will produce sperm bearing 25%lower viability.See  also  Gene,  Expression,  Phenotype,  Deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA),  Heredity,  Gene  silencing,Differentiation,  DNA  methylation,  Alkylating  agents,  Chromatin,  Chromatin  remodeling,  Histones,Short interfering RNA (siRNA), MicroRNAs, Gene imprinting, Imprinting, Organism, Central dogma(new),  Cancer,  Cell,  Hedgehog  signaling  pathway,  Paramutation,  Nucleolar  dominance,  Epigeneticvariation,  Epigenomics,  Histone  deacetylase  inhibitors,  Epigenetic  therapy,  Short-chain  fatty  acids,Genomic imprinting, X chromosome, Ubiquitination, Biotinylation, Posttranslational modification ofprotein, long noncoding RNAs, Vernalization.', 'Epigenetic Inheritance': 'Refers to the process via which epigenetic changes are expressed in the offspring of the organism towhich the initial epigenetic changes (accomplished via epigenetic marks on its DNA, such as DNAmethylation) occurred.

Ethylene results in asignal going to the cell’s nucleus, which initiates gene transcription so the plant adjusts according tothe particular stress condition that it faces. Those adjustments include leaves wilting or rolling up (toreduce loss of water via leaf transpiration/evaporation) and premature leaf senescence (aging). Forcrop plants, that unfortunately results in reduced photosynthetic efficiency, loss of chlorophyll, poorpollination, and/or flower, fruit, and seed loss.Ethylene is also synthesized when needed to instruct petioles (i.e., the part of the plant that connectsa leaf to the plant’s stem) to grow/elongate (e.g., if another nearby plant causes that petiole’s leaf tobe in shade).In some plants (e.g., petunias, carnations, orchids), ethylene causes their flowers to shed their petals(i.e.,  abscission)  in  the  autumn,  via  activating  genes  within  the  flower  that  cause  production  ofhydrolytic  enzymes.

The structure of triglyceride moleculesconsists of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecular backbone, so “triglyceride” molecules aremore accurately called “triacylglycerides,” but the term “triglyceride” is most often used.Two separate components of plant cells are involved in the synthesis (i.e., manufacturing) of plantfats (lipids): the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis of fatty acids begins in the plastid,where  Ac-CoA  is  first  carboxylated  (thereby  becoming  malonyl  CoA)  via  the  enzyme  acetyl-CoAcarboxylase. Next, a group of seven related enzymes (known as “fatty acid synthetases”) catalyzessynthesis of palmitoyl-CoA (which is a long molecule possessing 18 carbon atoms in its “molecularbackbone”),  although  shorter-length  molecules  result  when  a  specific  acyl  carrier  protein  (ACP)thioesterase  enzyme  is  present  in  plastid  (e.g.,  C16:0ACP),  which  results  in  fatty  acids  of  various“carbon chain” length. After the palmitoyl-CoA is elongated (i.e., made a longer molecule via additionof  carbons  to  its  molecular  backbone)  to  become  the  (stearate-like)  molecule  “oleoyl-ACP”  in  achemical  reaction  catalyzed  by  a  palmitoyl  elongase  enzyme,  the  oleoyl-ACP  is  transported  to  theplant’s  endoplasmic  reticulum.  In  the  endoplasmic  reticulum,  the  oleoyl-ACP  is  either  furtherelongated  (via  the  addition  of  more  carbon  atoms  to  the  fatty  acid’s  molecular  carbon  chain“backbone”)  or  further  desaturated  (i.e.,  via  desaturase-catalyzed  removal  of  hydrogen  atoms  fromthat fatty acid molecule). Stearic acid (also known as stearate) is desaturated to become oleic acid,which can be desaturated to become linoleic acid, which can be desaturated to become linolenic acid.Three of the resultant fatty acid molecules are then chemically attached to a glycerol-3-phosphatemolecule (with the cleaved-off phosphate atom “recycled” in the endoplasmic reticulum for furtherutilization in the energy cycle of the cell).The  content  levels  of  individual  fatty  acids  vary  somewhat  with  the  diet  of  the  animal  (i.e.,  foranimal fat) and vary somewhat with the plant’s growing conditions (i.e., for plant fat also known asvegetable oil). No natural fat is either totally saturated or unsaturated.When  eaten,  fats  are  generally  not  absorbed  directly  through  the  intestinal  wall.  They  are  firstemulsified and then hydrolyzed by the lipase enzyme. The components (i.e., fatty acids, cholesterol,monoacylglycerol,  phospholipids,  etc.)  form  micelles  that  pass  through  the  intestinal  wall  and  areabsorbed  by  the  body.  Such  emulsification/micelle  formation  is  aided  by  the  nutrient  lecithin  (acomponent in soybeans).When fats are oxidized in cells, they provide energy for the body. Some of the energy is released asheat and some is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate, which “fuels” metabolic processes.

In general, fats possessing the highest levels of saturated fatty acidstend to be solid at room temperature, and those fats possessing the highest levels of unsaturated fattyacids  tend  to  be  liquid  at  room  temperature.  That  rule  of  thumb  was  the  original  “dividing  line”between compounds called fats and oils, respectively. In general, saturated fatty acids tend to be morestable (resistant to oxidation and thermal breakdown) than unsaturated fatty acids.In plant cells, fatty acids are synthesized (manufactured) in plastids.Fatty  acids  in  biological  systems  (e.g.,  produced  by  plants  in  oilseeds)  tend  to  contain  an  evennumber of carbon atoms in their molecular “backbone,” typically between 14 and 24 carbon atoms.The molecular backbone (alkyl chain) may be saturated (no double bonds) or it may contain one ormore double bonds.

When hydrolyzed (e.g., during digestion), the resultant isothiocyanate compounds can be toxicto certain pests.For example, when large amounts of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus)  are consumed by  humans, theglucosinolates build up in the body and can cause Lathyrism (i.e., an irreversible spastic paralysis ofthe legs).The glucosinolates in rapeseed (Brassica rapa) can impart a bitter taste to such plants’ oils and cancause goiter (goitre) when fed in large amounts to animals.If glucosinolates from seeds of the wild  mustard  weed  (Sinapis  arvensis) family  are  mixed intocanola meal (e.g., when those weeds grew in a canola field and that resultant canola is processed intocanola meal), such canola meal must first be diluted (e.g., via mixing in some soybean meal) in orderto reduce glucosinolate concentration (below the legal maximum allowance) before it is allowed to befed to livestock, in Canada.Some of the glucosinolates’ enzymatic  transformation products produced within  certain  brassicaplants are beneficial, or at least benign.

G-proteins are embedded in the surface membrane of cells, analogous to the way that thread isembedded in cloth via someone using an embroidery needle (i.e., the G-protein molecule threads itsway back and forth through the cell membrane seven times). G-proteins “receive chemical signals”from outside the cell (e.g., hormones) and “pass the signal” into the cell, so that cell can “respond tothe signal.”For example, a hormone, drug, growth factor, neurotransmitter, photons (light), or other “signal”binds  to  a  receptor  molecule  on  the  surface  of  the  cell’s  exterior  membrane.  That  receptor  thenactivates the G-protein (or hundreds of G-proteins, depending on the signal), each of which causes aneffector inside cell to produce a second “signal” chemical inside cell, which causes cell (nucleus) toreact to the original external chemical signal. The G-proteins are called thus, because they becomeGTP and GDP forms alternately, as part of their reaction cycle (i.e., in “passing the signal”).G-protein-coupled  receptors  play  crucial  roles  in  many  biological  processes  such  as  painperception,  vision,  blood  pressure  regulation,  sleep  regulation,  control  of  cancerous  cell  growth,allergic responses, and so on. In addition to carrying to the cell nucleus these signals, the cytoplasmicG-proteins also regulate certain cellular processes.There are 24 different types of G-proteins in humans. Dysfunction of certain G-proteins in humanscauses  the  salt  and  water  losses  inherent  in  cholera  (the  body’s  compromised  immune  defenseinherent in pertussis) and is believed responsible for some symptoms of diabetes and alcoholism.In plants (which have 1–4 types of G-proteins, depending on the plant species), G-proteins are partof  the  signaling  process  that  directs  the  plant’s  response  to  stressors  such  as  drought  or  disease.Dysfunction  of  G-proteins in  plants can  cause rapid  water loss  (wilting).

Also known as hyperacuterejection, it is caused by the attack of the recipient’s T lymphocytes (i.e., T cells, a certain class ofwhite blood cells) on the transplanted organ. The recipient’s T cells are able to distinguish betweenself and foreign cells and are hence able to recognize the foreign (nonself) cells of the transplantedorgan.  They  then  naturally  try  to  destroy  the  “foreign  invaders”  in  the  body.  This  then  constitutesrejection of the transplanted organ. From this it should be understood that there is nothing wrong withthe body, but that it is behaving exactly as it should.Another source of rejection is nonmatched human leukocyte antigens (HLA, a very complex arrayof  six  proteins  that  cover  the  surface  of  leukocytes  and  the  bone  marrow  cells  that  produceleukocytes). These HLA are usually different (i.e., a nonmatch) for individuals that are not geneticallyrelated  to  each  other.  Rejection  of  nonmatched  transplanted  organs  then  occurs  because  the  bodymanufactures antibodies against the nonmatched HLA, thereby leading that HLA to work in concertwith a protein molecule named integrin beta 4 to jointly stimulate cell growth and movement (e.g.,overproduction of endothelial cells on the interior of applicable blood vessels, thus blocking off bloodsupply  to  the  transplanted  organ).

It is utilized tojudge the effectiveness of a given chemical compound (e.g., an antibiotic) against bacteria types.The  test  consists  of  a  differential  staining  procedure,  which  allows  most  bacteria  to  be  visuallyseparated into two groups, known as Gram-Positive (G+) and Gram-Negative (G−). An antibiotic isdefined in terms of the group of (pathogenic) bacteria that it is effective against, which is known asthat antibiotic’s “spectrum of activity.” An antibiotic is said to have a spectrum of activity againstgram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, or the bacteria of both groups. An antibiotic that iseffective against both groups of bacteria is termed “broad spectrum” or “wide spectrum.” See alsoBacteria, Gram-positive (G+), Gram-negative (G−), Pathogenic, Cell, Antibiotic.', 'Gram-Negative (G−)': 'Pertaining to one of the most important ways of classifying bacteria by means of the differences in theway they stain. The set of bacteria that are not able to be stained (blue) when treated with the gramstaining  procedure.  Gram  negativity  (and  gram  “positivity”)  is  conferred  not  by  the  chemicalconstituents of the bacteria but rather by the physical structure of the bacteria cell wall. The stainingprocedure involves the (attempted) staining of all cells in a sample with a blue dye. Gram-negativebacteria have a second (outer) very thin peptidoglycan cell wall known as a capsule, whose outer layeris  largely  comprised  of  lipopolysaccharide,  which  forms  a  barrier  against  the  inflow  of  toxichydrophobic compounds (e.g., an antibiotic manufactured and excreted by another nearby microbe—and this blue dye).Hence, the washing procedure, which is an integral part of the overall staining procedure, washesout  the  blue dye  (known as crystal  violet)  from  the gram-negative bacteria. This leaves  the  gramnegative  bacteria  within  the  sample  colorless.  The  sample  cells  are  then  stained  with  a  red  acidiccounterstain  (dye)  such  as  acid  fuchsin  or  safranin.

In  the  case  of  fatty  acids,  thefraction of each isomeric form (trans vs. cis fatty acids) and the molecular chain length (of the fattyacids present) have a large impact on the melting characteristics of each (fat or oil), with shorter-chainfats melting at lower temperature.Hydrogenation  is  the  most  common  chemical  reaction  utilized  in  the  edible  oils  (processing)industry.  Hydrogenation  increases  the  solids  (i.e.,  crystalline  fat)  content  of  edible  fats/oils  andimproves  their  resistance  to  thermal  and  atmospheric  oxidation  (e.g.,  for  frying  of  foods).  Thoseincreases  in  solids  and  resistance  to  oxidation  result  from  the  reduction  in  the  fat/oil  relativeunsaturation,  plus  increased  geometric  and  positional  isomerization  of  the  fat/oil  molecules.  Theedible oil/fat hydrogenation reaction is accomplished by treating fats/oils with pressurized hydrogengas in the presence of a catalyst. As a result, the (usually) liquid oils are converted to more saturatedfats, which are semisolid at an ambient temperature of 72°F (22°C). The presence of trans fatty acidsin hydrogenated edible oils can be reduced significantly via changes in catalyst, temperature, pressure,and so on, utilized in the hydrogenation reaction. In general, natural oils and fats possessing meltingpoints  lower  than  121°F  (50°C)  are  nearly  completely  absorbed  in  the  digestive  system  of  typicalhumans.

Insulin  and  glucagon  are  the  most  importantregulators of fuel (food) metabolism. In essence, insulin signals the “fed” state to the body’s cells,which stimulates the storage of energy (fuel) in the form of fat and the synthesis of proteins (i.e.,tissue building/repair) in a variety of ways.Other  impacts  of  insulin  are  to  stimulate  the  uptake  of  amino  acids  by  tissues,  increase  thepermeability of cells to some ions (e.g., potassium), cause secretion of the hormone angiotensin II thatconstricts arteries, promote synthesis of free fatty acids in the liver, inhibit the breakdown of fat inadipose tissue, and so on. The disease known as diabetes results from a body’s inability to produceinsulin  or  its  insensitivity  to  the  insulin  that  is  produced.  That  inability/insensitivity,  and  thus  thedisease, can result from several different causes:Type I (also known as childhood or juvenile or early-onset) diabetes results when the body’sinsulin-making  tissue  is  destroyed  by  autoimmune  disease.  See  also  the  entry  for  Insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).Type  II  diabetes  results  when  the  body’s  insulin-utilizing  tissues  become  insensitive  toinsulin. This can occur when insulin causes the liver to synthesize an overabundance of freefatty  acids,  which  get  stored  in  adipose  tissue  in  the  form  of  triglycerides,  which  cansubsequently result in those triglyceride-laden tissues producing far fewer insulin receptors(i.e., thereby becoming insensitive to insulin).The  too-high  sugar  content  in  the  bloodstream  that  results  from  diabetes  causes  creation  of  freeradicals (high-energy oxygen atoms bearing an “extra” electron) that can damage the eyes, kidneys,and  extremity  arteries  (sometimes  necessitating  limb  amputation)  in  one  haplotype  (i.e.,  geneticsubgroup) of people (i.e., those possessing the larger-size molecules of haptoglobin—a blood protein).Some  research  indicates  that  consumption  of  amylose  (starch  only)  or  inulin  (fructoseoligosaccharide) in human diet as the primary carbohydrate source, instead of glucose (or other sugarsthat the human body converts to glucose), can help the human body to avoid Type II diabetes, byavoiding gluconeogenesis.In 1922, Canadian scientists Frederick Banting, Charles Best, J. J. R. MacLeod, and J. B. Collipsucceeded in extracting insulin from the pancreas of slaughtered livestock (cows, pigs) in a form thatcould be injected into diabetes patients as a substitute for human insulin. The English biochemist,Fred  Sanger,  was  first  to  determine  the  complete  amino  acid  sequence  of  the  insulin  molecule.

In the past, it was generally considered to be a “nonfunctioning” portion of theDNA molecule.However, during the 1990s, Malcolm Simon showed that some introns contain the “markers” thatscientists utilize to identify where a given gene (within DNA strand) begins and ends. For example,the genetic test (conducted on women) for the presence of a “BRCA 1” gene actually detects a DNA“marker” in the intron sequence near the “BRCA 1” gene, not the “BRCA 1” gene itself per se.Some small RNAs (short interfering RNAs) are coded for by specific DNA segments within certainintrons. There also exist within many introns, enhancers (i.e., particular short DNA segments that actto either increase/activate/“turn on” a given gene, or that act to decrease/silence/“turn off” a givengene). The genes that enhancers thereby regulate may be located up to several thousand base pairsdistant from that enhancer.Certain DNA segment(s) within some introns in an organism’s DNA can interact with (e.g., “turnon,” “turn off,” etc.) a specific gene that is located a long distance away (within same DNA molecule)from  that  initial  DNA  segment.  This  physical  interaction  (i.e.,  creation  of  a  large  loop  in  theorganism’s DNA molecule, to cause the applicable intron to “touch” the relevant gene) results in anapparent genetic effect. For example, via such DNA looping, aberrant DNA segments in 14 differentintrons result in increased risk of bowel cancer for those people whose DNA contains one or more ofthose aberrant DNA segments.Also, sometimes a given intron remains in the transcript (e.g., via alternative splicing), resulting ina  different  protein  expressed  by  the  same  gene.  For  example,  the  COX-3  enzyme  and  the  COX-1enzyme are both produced from the COX-1 gene. The COX-3 enzyme results when intron 1 is retainedin  the  mRNA  transcript.

Ions are produced by the dissociation (coming apart) of an (electrolyte)molecule  resulting  from  the  electrolyte  dissolving  in  solution.  One  example  is  the  dissociation  ofcommon table salt (i.e., sodium chlo-ride) in water, which results in positively charged sodium ions(called cations) and negatively charged chloride ions (called anions). Ions play critically importantroles in many biological processes such as nerve activity. See also Chelation, Chelating agent,  Ionchannels, Citric acid, Citrate synthase (CSb) gene.', 'Ion Channels': 'Refers  to  specialized  proteins  that  act  as  “pores”  (e.g.,  through  the  plasma  membrane  of  a  cell)through  which  certain  ions  (i.e.,  atoms  or  molecules  bearing  an  electrical  charge)  are  selectivelyallowed to pass. Examples include calcium channels, sodium channels, and potassium channels. Theselectivity  of  ion  channels  can  be  altered  when  specific  molecules  (e.g.,  in  the  blood  or  digestivefluids)  come  in  contact  with  the  plasma  membrane  (i.e.,  G-protein  receptors  coupled  to  the  ionchannel).For  example, the group of pharmaceuticals known as calcium  channel  blockers  (e.g.,  verapamil,amlodipine,  diltiazem,  nifedipine)  acts  to  “block”/hinder  the  movement  of  calcium  ions  throughcalcium ion channels (i.e., “pores” that had previously allowed calcium ions to enter relevant cells[i.e., in blood vessel walls] easily).Another example is the mode of action of the “cry” (crystal-like) proteins that are naturally presentwithin  Bacillus  thuringiensis  (B.t.)  bacteria.  When  eaten  by  certain  insects  (possessing  alkalinedigestive  fluids  in  their  stomach/gut),  cry  proteins  are  hydrolyzed  (i.e.,  chemically  “cut”)  intofragments.  One  of  those  fragments—60  kDa  in  size—attaches  to  specific  receptors  located  on  thesurface (membrane) of certain cells that line the inside (i.e., epithelium) of the insect’s midgut. Thatattachment to those receptors triggers ion channels in the (epithelium) cell’s membrane to suddenlyallow cations (i.e., atoms or molecules with positive electrical charge) to quickly flow out of the cell(which leads to death of all insect gut cells that the cry protein piece attached to).The ion channel known as SLAC1 is utilized by plants to control the opening and closing (e.g., inresponse to drought conditions) of the stomatal pores located on surface of plant leaves. Because thosestomatal pores must be open enough to allow carbon dioxide to enter the plant leaves (i.e., it is neededfor photosynthesis) and for oxygen to enter/exit the leaves—but must not allow too much water vaporto  exit  the  leaves  (especially  during  drought  conditions)—the  survival  of  a  plant  depends  on  theprecise regulation of stomatal pore openings in response to environmental stimuli that it achieves viaSLAC1.

The ions are thereby confined within the desired volume of space by highfrequency electrical fields.In ion  trap–based  mass  spectrometers,  the  voltages  of  the  electrodes  are  selectively  changed  tocause specific ions (i.e., pieces of the original sample molecules) to be ejected from the ion trap intothe spectrometer’s detector. As with all mass spectrometers, those “pieces of sample” are processed asfollows:They are separated by the differences in their mass-to-charge ratios.Their  exact  mass  is  determined  based  on  the  measurement  of  their  mass-to-charge  ratioswhile those “pieces” are passing through precisely known strength electromagnetic fields.The identity of the “pieces” is determined by comparison of their mass/charge (m/e) spectrato those within a database of known “pieces” (ions).See also Ion, Mass spectrometer, Molecular weight.', 'Ion-Exchange Chromatography': 'Separation  of  ionic  compounds  (which  include  nucleic  acids  and  proteins)  in  a  chromatographiccolumn  containing  a  polymeric  resin  (i.e.,  the  stationary  phase)  having  fixed  charge  groups.

Lecithin  added  to  wheatbased  flour  dough  at  a  rate  of  0.25%–0.6%  acts  as  a  dough  conditioner.  It  disperses  fat  evenlythroughout the dough, enabling that conditioned dough to trap more of the carbon dioxide produced byyeast during fermentation (rising) process. Such conditioned doughs tend to produce a bread of finegrain, larger baked volume, and improved slicing properties.Because  lecithin–phosphatidylcholine  naturally  contains  a  high  content  of  linoleic  acid,consumption  by  humans  of  lecithin–phosphatidylcholine  results  in  similar  impact  (e.g.,  loweredcholesterol levels in blood) as consumption of linoleic acid.Because dietary fats are generally not absorbed directly through the intestinal wall (when eaten),they must first be emulsified, to form micelles that can pass through the intestinal wall and thus beabsorbed  by  the  body.  That  emulsification/micelle  formation  is  aided  by  lecithin,  since  it  is  anemulsifier.  Lecithin  contains  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine,  which  binds  to  aparticular protein within the liver and thereby aids the liver’s metabolism of fats and glucose.Lecithin itself (also known as phosphatidylcholine) is a source of choline when digested and is acritical component of the lipoproteins that transport fat and cholesterol molecules in the bloodstream(e.g., from the digestive system, to body cells, to and from the liver).Lecithin  (phosphatidylcholine)  promotes  synthesis  of  high-density  lipoproteins  (HDLPs,  alsoknown as “good” cholesterol) by the liver, when lecithin is consumed by humans, thereby helping tolower blood levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLPs, also known as “bad” cholesterol).

Lectins are a common component of the surface (membranes) of plant and animal cellsand are so specific (regarding sugar molecules that they will or won’t combine with/(attach to) thatthey  discriminate  between  different  monosaccharides  and  different  oligosaccharides  (i.e.,  on  thesurfaces of adjacent cells within an organism).This capability to reversibly combine with sugar (i.e., carbohydrate) molecules (on the surface ofadjacent cells) is utilized byBacteria and other microorganisms, to adhere to (sugar molecules on surface of) host cells, asthe first step in the process of infecting those host cells.White blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), to adhere to the walls of blood vessels (endothelium),as the first step to leaving the bloodstream to go fight infection (pathogens, trauma) in tissueadjacent to that blood vessel. The lectin (glycoprotein) that adheres to the (endothelial sugarmolecule on) blood vessel wall is called L-selectin, or the homing receptor. The two sugarmolecules (glycoproteins) on the blood vessel wall (endothelium) are called P-selectin and Eselectin (also known as ELAM-1).Cancerous tumor cells, to adhere to the walls of blood vessels (endothelium) as part of thetumor-proliferation process known as metastasis (i.e., new tumors are “seeded” throughoutthe body via this process).Separate and apart from the above impacts, some plant lectins (e.g., in the seeds of certain plants) aretoxic to some of the animals that consume those seeds.Because the lining of the midgut (“stomach”) of certain insect pests is composed at least partiallyof chitin, genetically engineering a crop plant to produce within its applicable tissues the lectin knownas  HFR-3  (which  tightly  latches  onto  chitin  molecules)  can  help  such  crop  plants  to  resist  beingattacked by that particular insect pest.

Friedman  in  1994,  it  is  a  protein  hormone  that  is  produced  by  fat  cells(adipose  tissue)  in  the  body  (e.g.,  following  consumption  of  food).  When  leptin  is  produced  andtravels  to  neuron  cells  whose  surface  bears  leptin  receptors  (e.g.,  in  the  brain),  those  brain  cellsreceive signal (transduction) indicating fullness/satiety. The brain cells are also informed about thebody’s current metabolic state.For example, Canadian scientists devised a test to detect which variant (SNP) of the “leptin gene” ispossessed  by  dairy  cattle  breeding  stock.  By  selecting  only  cattle  possessing  the  “leptin-tt”  SNPwithin their DNA (i.e., SNP with the lowest level of leptin production), it is expected that such futurecattle herds will have inherently larger appetites and thus larger milk production potential.Leptin  has  been  found  to  be  present  in  the  bloodstream  of  obese  humans  at  a  concentration  ofapproximately  four  times  the  concentration  found  in  bloodstreams  of  lean  humans.  Obese  humanstend to be less insensitive to leptin. High levels of leptin present in the bloodstream disrupt some ofthe activities of insulin (hormone that regulates blood sugar levels) and may possibly lead to diabetes.Research indicates that sleep deprivation (e.g., less than 8 hours per night, for most people) leads todecreased leptin levels.See also Hormone, Adipokines, Protein, Biological activity, Gene, Single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs), Metabolism, Insulin, Adipose.', 'Leptin Receptors': 'Cellular  receptors  that  are  specific  to  leptin.

That gene causes corn (maize) hybrids possessing it to produce much less phytate than the0.15% typically present in traditional varieties of corn (maize). Because phytate is not digestible inhumans and other monogastric animals (e.g., swine, poultry), substituting low-phytate corn in place oftraditional corn varieties in those animals’ diets helps to lessen the adverse environmental impact ofanimal feeding (e.g., phosphorous emissions in excess of annual cropland requirements).Swine fed a diet in which traditional corn (maize) varieties have been replaced by low-phytate corn(maize)  produce  up  to  30%  less  phosphorous  in  their  manure,  thereby  lessening  the  phosphorousimpact of those swine on the environment.Humans consuming a diet based heavily on corn/maize (e.g., tortillas) absorb 50% more iron whentraditional  corn  varieties  are  replaced  by  low-phytate  corn  varieties.

They (and other phagocytic cells) are largely responsible for thelocalization and degradation of foreign materials at inflammatory sites.Macrophages  display  chemotaxis  (i.e.,  the  sensing  of,  and  movement  toward  or  away  from  aspecific chemical). For example, consumption (in food/feed) of mannanoligosaccharides by mammalscauses macrophages (within that mammal’s bloodstream) to depart from the bloodstream and movetoward the gastrointestinal tract (tissues) where those macrophages eliminate some pathogens (i.e.,those growing/reproducing in the gastrointestinal tract).When n-3 fatty acids (“omega-3” fatty acids) are present within macrophages, the enzyme known ascyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) changes those n-3 fatty acids into metabolites known as electrophilic fattyacid oxidation (EFOX) derivatives that alter expression patterns of some macrophage genes, therebyreducing  the  inflammation  impact  noted  within  the  first  paragraph.

Upon  receiving  the  “message”  that  wasencoded in the DNA, the messenger RNA passes through the ribosomes like a reel of punched paperpasses through an old player piano (pianola) giving the ribosomes the specifications for making thecoded-for proteins (akin to how the punched paper causes a pianola to play the tune that is coded inthe paper).This process is aided by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which forage for amino acids that floataround in the cell (outside of the cell’s nucleus and ribosomes). The transfer RNA (tRNA) moleculesattach  to,  and  escort  individual  amino  acids  to  the  ribosome,  as  and  when  the  messenger  RNA(mRNA) directs. Each of the 20 different amino acids has at least one of its own purpose-built tRNAmolecules, which possess a three-letter code of nucleotides at the stem of the cloverleaf-shaped rRNAmolecule.The  ribosome  has  room  for  only  two  tRNA  molecules  at  a  time.  The  messenger  RNA  (mRNA)molecule (which itself is passing through the ribosome) calls over the first tRNA molecule, whichbrings with it the specified amino acid. Short sections of the messenger RNA (mRNA) and transferRNA (tRNA) molecules lock together inside the ribosome (because where these two molecules meet,their  three  nucleotides  are  complementary),  the  whole  (locked  together)  apparatus  shifts  along  bythree notches (i.e., nucleotides), and a second tRNA molecule (bearing another amino acid) slips innext to the first tRNA molecule.Next, the first amino acid (brought in by the first tRNA molecule) jumps over to the second tRNAmolecule,  joining  to  the  amino  acid  that  was  brought  in  by  the  second  tRNA  molecule  and  thusmaking the start of a protein (i.e., a poly-amino acid molecule, also known as polypeptide or proteinmolecule).  The  empty  (first)  tRNA  molecule  falls  out  of  the  ribosome,  and  the  whole  (lockedtogether)  apparatus  (i.e.,  mRNA  plus  second  tRNA  molecule)  moves  three  more  notches  (i.e.,nucleotides)  along  the  mRNA  molecule  to  make  room  for  a  third  tRNA  molecule  bearing  anotheramino acid, and so on.This  process  of  creating  ever-longer  chains  of  amino  acids  continues  to  repeat  itself  inside  theribosome  until  the  protein  (coded  for  by  the  DNA,  which  code  was  transferred  to  mRNA,  whichtransferred it to the ribosome) is completed.

That  is  because  a  transition  of  epithelial  cells  becomingmesenchymal  (thereby  enabling  cell  motility)  is  the  typical  first  step  of  cancer  metastasis.Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), synthesized/exuded by platelets and by the canceroustumor, leads epithelial tissue to dissolve the tight junctions between cells (e.g., in epithelium), andthen those cells undergo morphogenesis to mesenchymal phenotype, as prelude to cancer “invasion”of adjacent tissues.One symptom of prostate cancer metastasis beginning/occurring in humans is expression on thosecancer cells of the RANKL signaling protein (which activates osteoclasts), thereby making the bonesmore receptive to metastatic tumor entry.In some cancers hypoxia-inducible factors, which are master control proteins, “turn on” numerousparticular genes that help cells adapt to a scarcity of oxygen (e.g., in cells within a specific tissue in anorganism). Although these genetic responses are essential for continuation of a normal cell’s life, thehypoxia-inducible factors also can turn on additional genes that help certain cancerous cells (withinoxygen-starved tumors) to metastasize (i.e., escape the tumor) via moving on their own to invade thebody’s blood vessels, through which they spread to other tissues of the body.When  certain  Janus  kinases  get  “switched  on,”  it  can  lead  to  (muscle-like)  contractions  withintumor cells that generate a force that causes the tumor’s cells to move (e.g., through narrow spaces)and  thereby  metastasize.

MicroRNAsthereby  help  regulate  an  organism’s  early  development,  cell  differentiation,  apoptosis,immune system, and so on, including via RNA interference (RNAi). MicroRNAs were provenby Ji-Young Lee in 2010 to routinely move between cells as a regulatory signaling molecule.The first microRNA was discovered by Victor Ambros in 1993.MicroRNAs are directly coded for by an organism’s genes. For example, in animals theenzyme known as Drosha subsequently recognizes the applicable microRNA (i.e., within anRNA hairpin loop) and cuts it out of applicable RNA transcripts. That cutout RNA segment isthen transported within the cell (to relevant DICER enzyme) where it is cleaved into the samelength (21–24 nucleotides long) as siRNA.For  example,  during  the  embryo  development  of  vertebrate  animals,  the  gene  known  as“Lfng” recognizes the microRNA known as “mir-125a-5p” in the “mir-125a-5p”-controlled“Lfng” cyclical gene activity that defines the timing of the formation of somites (i.e., tissuesegments that later become muscle and vertebrae).It is estimated that approximately 60% of human genes are regulated by microRNAs.Small chemically synthesized RNA segments, which are designed to mimic the products (i.e.,siRNA segments) of Dicer enzymes, in terms of causing RNA interference.Some  malfunctions  of  microRNAs  can  lead  to  some  cancers,  heart  disorders,  immune  systemdisorders, or dementia diseases.Research indicates that microRNAs can also causeSome  genes  within  certain  invading  (e.g.,  pathogenic)  viruses  to  shut  down  (via  RNAsilencing), thereby preventing infection of the host.Some genes within a plant’s DNA to revert to (grandparent’s) wild-type version of the gene,when both parents’ DNA contained a mutated version of the gene.Inhibition  of  expression  of  some  cancer-causing  enzymes.

When  certain  tumors  (e.g.,  prostate  cancer)  lose  miR-101  via  genomicdeletion,  then  EZH2  can  be  overexpressed  (resulting  in  an  epigenetic  change  that  leads  tocancer metastasis).See  also  Ribonucleic  acid  (RNA),  Messenger  RNA  (mRNA),  Translation,  Deoxyribonucleic  acid(DNA), Gene,  Gene expression, Regulatory  sequence,  Regulatory genes,  RNA  interference  (RNAi),Epigenetic, Organism, Embryology, Differentiation, Cell differentiation, Wild type, Mutation, Codingsequence, Apoptosis, Dicer enzymes, Short interfering RNA (siRNA), Pathogen, Virus, Paramutation,Hairpin  loop,  Somites,  Enzyme,  Inhibition,  Histones,  Methylated,  Homologous  (chromosomes  orgenes), Cancer, Cancer epigenetics, Metastasis, miRNA genes, Gene silencing, Signaling molecule,Transcriptome, Artificial interfering RNA (aiRNA).', 'Microsatellite DNA': 'Pieces  of  the  same  small  DNA  segment  (e.g.,  a  DNA  sequence  such  as  CACACACA)  that  are“repeated”  (appear  repeatedly  in  sequence  within  the  DNA  molecule)  adjacent  to  a  specific  genewithin the DNA molecule.

When  they  do,  the  material  is  taken  up(engulfed) and degraded by means of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymatic attack. Peptides that resultfrom the degradation of foreign protein are then bound to a monocyte protein called class II MHC(major histocompatibility complex) and this self-foreign complex then migrates to the surface of thecell where it is embedded into the cell membrane in such a way as to present the peptide to the outsideof the cell. This positioning allows T lymphocytes to recognize (inspect) the peptide.

For thatapplication, nanoshells are made of materials/thicknesses selected to absorb specific wavelengths ofinfrared light (which human tissue is transparent to) and are “surface modified” (via attachment ofmolecular  bridges  to  surface)  so  they  will  accumulate  inside  tumors.  Once  the  nanoshells  haveaccumulated  within  the  tumor,  subsequent  shining  of  intense  infrared  light  of  the  appropriatewavelength at that tumor causes the nanoshells to heat up and kill the tumor tissue, without harm toadjacent noncancerous tissue.Another  version  of  that  (tumor-destroying)  application  is  to  manufacture  such  nanoshells  frommagnetic  element(s)  and  then  cause  them  to  heat  up  in  the  tumor  via  application  of  oscillatingmagnetic fields.Another  potential  application  is  to  utilize  silica-  or  iron  oxide  nanoparticles  to  swiftly  “gluetogether” soft tissues (especially liver tissue, which can be traumatized by sutures) during surgery.When these nanoparticles (in a water solution) are simply dabbed onto the edges of the tissue, thenanoparticles adsorb onto surface of both pieces of the tissue in a process known as nanobridging, andthe subsequently pressed-together tissue swiftly adheres together.See  also  Nanotechnology,  Nanoscience,  Nanovaccine,  Nanocrystals,  Nanoceria,  Nanocapsules,Nanoshells,  Cell,  Cancer,  Carbon  nanotubes,  Carbon  nanohorns,  Nanobatteries,  Dendrimersomes,Lignin nanotubes, Nanobodies, Nanobionics, Paclitaxel, Albumin, Liposomal nanoparticles.', 'Nanobodies': 'Refers  to  the  smallest  possible  portion  of  an  antibody  which  will  bind  to  an  antigen/hapten.Nanobodies tend to be approximately one-tenth the size of antibodies.

Because such nanobodies can be relativelyeasily attached to nanoparticles or to large protein molecules, they might be readily targeted to attackcertain cancer-related proteins in the future.Because nanobodies are less sensitive to high temperatures and pH changes than antibodies, theyare able to survive highly acidic conditions (e.g., passage through the stomach) without losing theirbiological  activity,  so  they  could  potentially  be  utilized  in  some  future  orally  administeredpharmaceuticals.

Onetype of nano-motor can be made by torsionally curling “carbon nantube yarn” (i.e., long fiber built ofcarbon nanotubes oriented longitudinally and twist spun), which subsequently twists/untwists whencharge is injected into the electrolyte that nanomotor is immersed in. During 2011, Javad Foroughiand colleagues showed that such a carbon nanotube yarn can be utilized to create a nanomotor (e.g., topower a liquid mixer within a microfluidic chip) that spins at 590 rpm.For  example,  during  2011,  Joseph  Wang  and  Liangfeng  Zhang  created  a  nanorocket  (i.e.,  ananometer-scale long structure consisting of concentric tubes of platinum, iron, and an outer layer ofgold)  which  is  powered  on  its  “flight”  through  biological  fluids  by  the  breakdown  of  hydrogenperoxide on the nanorocket’s inner platinum surface (where oxygen bubbles are formed then expelledout  the  backside  of  the  nanorocket).  The  nanorocket  is  guided  through  the  biological  fluid  (e.g.,bloodstream)  via  use  of  directed  magnets  that  act  upon  the  iron  contained  within  the  wall  of  thenanorocket. Antibodies or single strands of DNA can be attached to the outer layer of gold via a thiolgroup, in order for such nanorockets to capture specific cells (e.g., cancerous cells that the antibodiesare specific to) or to hybridize onto specific DNA segments (e.g., in bloodstream) as the nanorockets“fly” through that fluid.For  example,  during  2014,  Zev  Bryant  and  Muneaki  Nakamura  created  nanomotors  that  arecontrolled  (speed,  direction)  by  light  shining  on  them.  The  motors  consisted  of  protein  moleculescoded  for  by  a  synthetic  gene  (DNA  sequence)  that  was  itself  assembled  from  DNA  segmentsextracted from pig, slime mold, and oats DNA.Theoretically  at  least,  such  nanomotors  could  also  be  powered  via  nanopiezoelectronics,nanobatteries,  light  shined  onto  the  nanomotor,  directed  use  of  Casimir  force,  and  so  on.

Since those particular fluorescent nanoparticles show up well in magnetic resonanceimaging, this may someday be utilized for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in humans.Detection  of  cancer  metastasis:  Magnetic  nanoparticles  (100  nm  diameter)  attached  toantibodies against epithelial cells can be utilized to detect metastasis of cancer in a human.The magnetized antibodies attach themselves to epithelial cells (a biomarker of metastasis) ina blood sample, enabling the epithelial cells to be detected/counted by doctors.Detection of DNA hybridization: When relevant DNA molecules/segments are “labeled” inadvance with superparamagnetic particles, those “labeled DNA segments” can be utilized inmagnetic  DNA  microarrays  to  detect  when/which  DNA  segments  are  hybridized  (by  DNAwithin samples being analyzed).Delivery  of  some  pharmaceuticals:  For  example,  when  molecules  of  certain  statin  drugs(which  have  an  anti-inflammatory  impact  within  blood  vessel  walls)  are  delivered  toapplicable (plaque-lined) blood vessel walls by encasing the statin molecules inside a layer ofhigh-density  lipoprotein  (HDL,  the  so-called  good  cholesterol)  molecules,  whichsubsequently attach themselves to HDL receptors on blood vessel walls, thereby deliveringthose statins where needed (to prevent a second heart attack immediately following first heartattack). For example, when molecules of man-made tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are attachedto certain nanoparticles of applicable size (70 nm diameter), TNF can act to disrupt formationof the new vasculature (blood vessels) needed by the tumor for blood supply (e.g., when TNFis delivered in the form of a concentrated pharmaceutical via nanoparticles that preferentiallyaccumulate  in  tumors).  Another  potential  mode  of  drug  delivery  into  cancer  cells  is  viadrilling of holes in those cells by “nanodrills.”Delivery  of  short  interfering  RNA  (siRNA)  to  specific  tissues  within  the  body  in  order  toinduce  RNA  interference  (RNAi)  in  those  tissues  (e.g.,  to  thereby  cure  certain  diseases).Altering  the  surface  chemistry  of  the  nanoparticles  changes  the  tissue  that  the  siRNA  iscarried to.Prolonging the bloodstream circulation time of some pharmaceuticals in the body. Note thatapplicable  drugs  or  drug  carriers  (e.g.,  certain  nanoparticles)  bearing  a  slightly  negativecharge have a longer circulation time.Creation of plastic antibodies via molecular imprinting.Killing of the harmful bacteria within some biofilms: When iron oxide particles possessingan average diameter of 8 nm are injected and guided via an externally applied magnetic fieldto the biofilm that has formed on a medical implant within the body.Creation  of  some  liposomal  nanoparticles:  The  term  “liposomal  nanoparticles”  refers  tonanoparticles  encapsulated  within  a  shell  composed  of  a  combination  of  liposomes  andpolyethylene  glycol.  Certain  pharmaceutical  compounds  (e.g.,  doxorubicin)  can  thereby  bedelivered to certain sites within a patient’s body (e.g., the immature/growing blood vesselsthat  supply  nutrients  to  certain  cancerous  tumors)  without  the  pharmaceutical  compounddispersing to tissues throughout the body. That is because such pharmaceutical compoundswhich tend to be rapidly degraded in the bloodstream are protected fromdegradation/dispersion while in the bloodstream via being enclosed within the liposomes andpolyethylene  glycol,  so  that  more  of  the  nondegraded/nondispersed  pharmaceutical  wouldremain by the time it reached the targeted tissue (i.e., the tumor).

Initially conceived by HaganBayley, David Deamer, and Mark Akeson in 2001, it can be manufactured in several different ways:1.  Consists of an artificial membrane (lipid bilayer) with a “hole” (nanopore) punctured in thatmembrane by the protein alpha-hemolysin or by a single-walled carbon nanotube.2.  Consists of a membrane (lipid bilayer) with the “hole” formed by an applicable membrane-spanning protein molecule.3.  Consists of a sheet of graphene or silicon with a hole (between 1 and 100 nm in diameter)bored through it via electron beam equipment.4.  Consists of a sheet of graphene/silicon bearing a much larger hole, then the smaller “porehole” is made via filling in most of the larger hole with carefully structured DNA origami;leaving the “pore hole” surrounded by DNA/chemical groups which assist in the detection ofeach DNA sequence as a strand passes through the “pore.”Because a DNA molecule moving through such a “nanopore” temporarily blocks the nanopore (until itdissociates into a single DNA strand and “slides” through), an electrical current/voltage applied to thatnanopore varies (in amplitude, modulation, duration, etc.) as the DNA strand “slides through”, in away that provides information (e.g., to scientist) about the nucleotides that makeup that DNA strand.It  is  expected  that  nanopores  will  also  be  used  for  DNA  sequencing.

Electrical  repulsion  (to  the  solution’s  positive  charge)  then  causes  the  DNAmolecule to pass through the nanopore slowly.The nanopore usually consists of an artificial membrane (lipid bilayer) with a “hole” in it caused bythe  protein  alpha-hemolysin  or  by  a  single-walled  carbon  nanotube.  It  could  also  be  a  sheet  ofgraphene or silicon with a hole bored in it. Because a DNA molecule moving through such a nanoporetemporarily blocks the nanopore, a separate electrical voltage applied to the nanopore by the scientistwill vary (in amplitude, modulation, duration, etc.) as the DNA molecular strand “slides through” in away that provides information to detection instruments about each of the nucleotides that make up thatDNA  molecule.

The nanorocketis guided through the biological fluid (e.g., bloodstream) via use of directed magnets that act upon theiron contained within the wall of the nanorocket. Antibodies or single strands of DNA can be attachedto the outer layer of gold via a thiol group, in order for such nanorockets to capture specific cells (e.g.,cancerous cells that the antibodies are specific to) or to hybridize onto specific DNA segments (e.g., inbloodstream) as the nanorockets “fly” through that fluid.During 2012, a nanorocket powered by water breakdown was created.

When a very small amount of mercury was added to that solution, thegold and the mercury combined into an amalgam which changed the effective length of the nanorods.Because that resulted in an optically detectable change in the surface plasmon resonance of the goldnanorods, this experiment demonstrated that such nanorods could be utilized to make an extremelysensitive  (i.e.,  measure  as  low  as  parts  per  quadrillion)  detector  of  mercury  and/or  some  otherbiologically relevant elements/compounds.During  2013,  Joseph  Tracy  discovered  that  carefully  controlled  addition  of  ascorbic  acid  duringsolution manufacturing of gold nanorods enables control of the resultant gold nanorods’ aspect ratio(i.e., the relative height and width of those “solid cylinders”). The slower the ascorbic acid was added,the  shorter—versus  their  width—the  resultant  nanorods  became.  Because  the  optical  properties  ofgold nanorods depend on their aspect ratio, long “skinny” gold nanorods absorb light at wavelengthsof greater than 800 nm (i.e., within the near-infrared spectrum), but shorter “fat” gold nanorods absorblight at wavelengths below 700 nm (red or dark red portion of spectrum). This “tunable” control of thenanorods’ wavelength absorbance may enable their future use in destruction of tumors within the body(e.g., get the gold nanorods to accumulate inside tumors, then heat the nanorods enough to kill tumorcells via directing intense radiation of specific wavelength at the tumor).

When  bulk  silver  metal  is  formed  into  nanoscale  particles,  it  exhibitsextremely potent antimicrobial properties and it emits colors (not fluorescence) when those particlesare  illuminated  with  laser  light.  When  they  are  formed  into  certain  specific  nanometer-scalestructures, gold, platinum, silver, palladium, and some other transition metals demonstrate magneticbehavior.Another example is that semiconductor material nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots) emit larger-than-typical-for-such  material  amounts  of  light,  when  stimulated  (i.e.,  bombarded)  with  pulses  ofultraviolet light.

For  example,  nanoshells  can  be  manufactured  by  surrounding  cobaltnanoparticles  with  sulfur  (in  a  9:8  ratio).  When  the  proper  reaction  conditions  are  subsequentlyapplied  to  this  9:8  cobalt/sulfur  mixture,  the  Kirkendall  effect  causes  the  cobalt  atoms  within  thenanoparticle to diffuse out to (and react with) the sulfur atoms faster than the sulfur atoms diffuse into the nanoparticle. The end result is a spherical nanoshell comprised of the compound Co9S8.When  nanoshells  are  constructed  from  polymers,  they  are  called  polymersomes.  One  self-assembling DNA nanoshell, whose surface was studded with folic acid ligands and whose center wasfilled with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), was created by Zhen Gu and colleagues in 2014.When  the  folic  acid  ligands  attach  to  receptors  on  the  surface  of  cancer  cells,  the  cell  pulls  thenanoshell inside, where its anticancer drug payload is released.Another  potential  application  of  certain  nanoshells  is  to  inject  them  into  a  cancer  patient’sbloodstream.  For  that  application,  nanoshells  are  made  of  materials/thicknesses  selected  to  absorbspecific wavelengths of near-infrared light (which human tissue is transparent to) and are “surfacemodified” (via attachment of molecular bridges to surface of the nanoshell) so they will accumulateinside tumors. Once the nanoshells have accumulated within the tumor, subsequent shining of intensenear-infrared light of the appropriate wavelength at that tumor causes the nanoshells to heat up andkill the tumor tissue, without harm to adjacent noncancerous tissue.Another  version  of  that  (tumor-destroying)  application  is  to  manufacture  such  nanoshells  frommagnetic  element(s)  and  then  cause  them  to  heat  up  in  the  tumor  via  application  of  oscillatingmagnetic fields. This is referred to as magnetic fluid hyperthermia.The  self-assembling  capsid  (hard  outer  spherical  protein  shell)  of  certain  viruses  can  also  beconsidered to be a “nanoshell” (when empty of contents). During 2004, Gijs Wuite determined with anatomic force microscope that the capsid of one particular spherical virus possesses a Young’s modulus(measure of “hardness”) that is similar to the Young’s modulus of some hard synthetic plastics.

Those AS14111 strands bind to nucleolin, a protein that is overexpressed inmost cancer cells plus is expressed in the cell surface membrane, as well as within the cancer cell.After binding to a surface nucleolin molecule, the aptamer-laden nanostars are shuttled through theouter cell membrane and carried inside to the cell nucleus. When subsequently exposed to ultrafastpulses  of  light,  the  thiol  bonds  are  cleaved  by  the  pulsed  light,  and  the  (now)  un-thiolated  DNAaptamers enter the nucleus where they act to kill the cancer cell via restoring its apoptosis pathway.See also Nanoparticles, Nanometers (nm), Thiol, Aptamer, Protein, Nucleolin, Cell, Cancer, Nucleus,Apoptosis.', 'Nanostructured Material': 'Refers to a (macro) material possessing some properties (e.g., optical, electrical, tensile, etc.) whichresult from the nanometer-scale structure of the atoms comprising that material.

The pitch that is inherent within those individually twisted“stacked polymer” molecules results in their length over which they twist a full 360° being the sameorder of magnitude as the wavelengths of visible light.

Martin et al.were able to manufacture antibody-laced nanotube membranes via:First creating alumina films which naturally possess cylindrical pores extending through thefilm.Then “growing” silica nanotubes within those pores using special sol–gel chemistry methods.Then coating the interior surfaces of the silica nanotubes with aldehyde silanes.And finally, reacting the free amino sites (on antibody fragments—raised against one of theenantiomers in a racemic mixture) with the aldehydes (on the aldehyde silane molecules),thereby attaching antibodies to the interior surfaces of the nanotubes.Thus constructed, the antibody-laced nanotube membranes were utilized by those scientists to separateout the desired enantiomer from a racemic mixture (racemate).Another example of the use of nanotubes is the 2004 discovery by Thomas Webster and colleaguesthat coating a titanium object (e.g., the stem of an artificial hip joint) with nanotubes constructed from“rings” comprising guanine and cytosine results in significantly improved attachment (to the artificialhip) by bone osteoblast cells as the bone grows around the stem following hip replacement surgery.See  also  Nanoscience,  Nanometers  (nm),  Nanotechnology,  Antibody,  Amino  acid,  Enantiomers,Racemate,  Enantiopure,  Ultrafiltration,  Self-assembly  (of  a  large  molecular  structure),  Guanine,Cytosine, Nanorocket, Nanodrills.', 'Nanotube Membranes': 'See Nanotube, Carbon nanotubes.', 'Nanovaccine': 'Refers  to  particularly  small  gold  nanorods  (e.g.,  21  nm  wide  and  57  nm  long  in  the  case  of  therespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—the first one created), which are approximately the same shape andsize  as  the  virus  that  one  is  planning  to  vaccinate  against.

That  nanovalve  consisted  of  a  rotaxane  molecule  that  is  attachedDIRECTLY  OVER  A  PORE  to  the  surface  of  porous  glass.  When  a  relevant  molecule  (e.g.,  apharmaceutical)  is  first  inserted  into  the  pore  and  the  rotaxane  molecule  is  subsequently  attachedabove the open end of the pore, this results in a system via which the pharmaceutical molecule can bereleased at the time desired by man (e.g., when needed to treat a disease, stimulate an organ such as aweakened heart, etc.).Other nanovalves have been created, that are opened via shining light onto a particular nanovalve,changing the pH (to become basic) in a solution surrounding a particular nanovalve, and so on.

For example, of the nearly 300 “disease-causing” genes in the humangenome, more than half of them have an analogous gene within the genome of C. elegans.Some nematodes are parasitic. Those nematodes that are parasitic to animals puncture the innerlining of the animal’s gut and can impede the absorption of nutrients.The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) infests peanut, potato, cotton, and certain othercrop plants. As a result of it feeding on plant roots, a knot-like feeding site forms on the host-croproots that restricts the plant’s access to nutrients normally supplied by those roots.The soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), also referred to as SCN, lives in soil and feedsparasitically  on  roots  of  the  soybean  plant.  These  nematodes  use  a  spear-like  mouthpart,  called  astylet, to puncture the plant’s root cells so the nematodes can eat their cell contents. That root damagecauses the soybean’s growth to be stunted, and the plants turn yellow because of a reduction in noduleformation  by  the  nitrogen-fixing  Rhizobium  bacteria  (which  normally  colonize  healthy  roots  ofsoybean plants). SCN damage can combine with a fungus (Fusarium solani) to cause a soybean plantdisease known as “sudden death syndrome.”Another  phytoparasitic  nematode  is  Criconemoides  sp.,  which  feeds  on  the  sugarcane  plant(Saccharum sp.).One Antarctic nematode (Panagrolaimus davidi) is able to survive Antarctic winters by drying outand achieving a state of “suspended animation” (anhydrobiosis) for as long as 39 years.

Nitricoxide can bind to the Heme-Nitric Oxide/Oxygen (H-NOX) domain on a particular specific enzyme,activating that enzyme and beginning the chemical cascades that lead to physiological functions suchas blood vessel dilation. When needed for such purposes, nitric oxide is released from “storage” innitrites and nitrosothiols (created earlier via exercise).Nitric oxide is also utilized by the human body for immune system regulation, and its synthesis inmacrophages is required for macrophages to kill pathogens and tumor cells (by oxidizing them afterthe macrophage has engulfed them).During the 1980s, John Garthwaite and Solomon H. Snyder showed that nitric oxide is an importantmessenger molecule utilized in neural signaling (i.e., NO is an important signaling molecule in thehuman brain). Nitric oxide levels tend to be low in people who have Alzheimer’s disease.Nitric oxide increases the effectiveness of certain other reactive free radicals (e.g., superoxide O −2)in killing off any infected cells within a soybean plant.Nitric oxide also induces certain genes to code for the production of certain chemical compoundswhich protect the soybean plant and some other plants from bacterial plant diseases.See  also  Signaling  molecule,  Signaling,  Oxidizing  agent,  Pathogen,  Immune  response,  Humansuperoxide  dismutase  (hSOD),  Signal  transduction,  Nitric  oxide  synthase,  Nitrosylation,  Soybeanplant,  Protein,  Domain  (of  a  protein),  Enzyme,  Cascade,  Inducers,  Gene,  Coding  sequence,  Freeradical,  Endothelial  cells,  Endothelium,  Macrophage,  Adipose,  Bacteria,  Essential  amino  acids,Lysine,  Tumor,  Methionine,  Neurotransmitter,  Bioluminescence,  Angiogenesis,  Chemotaxis,Alzheimer’s disease.', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase': 'An enzyme that catalyzes the reaction which the body (of animals or plants) utilizes to make nitricoxide  from  L-arginine  (via  cleavage,  of  that  molecule).

The nucleus is surrounded by a (nuclear) membrane which is quite similar to the plasma(cell) membrane, except the nuclear membrane contains holes or pores. It is characterized by its highcontent of chromatin, which contains most of the cell’s DNA. That chromatin is normally (when cellis not in process of dividing) distributed throughout the nucleus in a diffuse manner.

These sugar (i.e., carbohydrate) chains are frequently attached to protein molecules. When thishappens, the resulting molecule is known as a glycoprotein—that is, a hybrid molecule that is partprotein and part sugar. The oligosaccharide portion affects a protein’s conformation(s) and biologicalactivity.  The  oligosaccharide  (carbohydrate)  portion  of  a  glycoprotein  functions  as  a  mediator  ofcellular uptake of that glycoprotein. Glycosylation thus affects the length of time the molecule residesin the bloodstream before it is taken out of circulation (serum lifetime). It is thought that blood group(e.g., A, B, O, etc.) is based upon an oligosaccharide concept. For example, different oligosaccharide“branches” on a given glycoprotein (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) could cause that glycoproteinto be perceived by the body’s immune system to be another (incorrect) blood type, thus provoking animmune response against it.One  natural  source  of  approximately  200  critically  important  oligosaccharides  is  human  breastmilk.  Although  humans  cannot  digest  those  oligosaccharides,  beneficial  gut  bacteria  (knowncollectively as the infant gut microbiome) thrive on them (which thus benefits the infants). The infantgut microbiome is overwhelmingly dominated by the bacterial species Bifidobacterium longum biovarinfantis (B. longum bv. infantis). The B. longum bv. infantis possess the precise enzymes needed toswiftly digest all the breast milk oligosaccharides, thereby denying those oligosaccharides to “bad”microbes  in  the  gut,  and  crowding  out  those  “bad”  microbes.  The  now  large  gut  population  of  B.longum bv. Infantis also produce short chain fatty acids that favor growth of many beneficial bacterialspecies, plus those short chain fatty acids help guide the particular cells that line an infant’s intestinein how to mount an immune defense and regarding how to best utilize energy.Oligosaccharides play a critical role in numerous disease processes in adults too (e.g., bacterial andviral  infection  processes,  cancer  metastasis  processes,  inflammation  processes,  etc.).  For  example,oligosaccharide molecular “chains” extending from the exterior membrane plasma membrane of cellsare utilized by bacteria (and inflammation-triggering immune system cells) to latch onto cells andfacilitate entry into cells.

The p53 protein that is coded for byp53 gene is a transcription factor (i.e., it “reads” DNA to determine if damaged, then acts to controlcell division, while p53 gene codes for more production of additional p53 protein to repair the DNAdamage). Discovered in 1993 by Arnold J. Levine and colleagues, to be responsible for approximately50% of all human cancer tumors (when the p53 gene is damaged/mutated).Normally, the p53 gene codes for (i.e., causes to be manufactured in cell) the p53 protein, whichacts to prevent cells from dividing uncontrollably when the cell’s DNA has been damaged (e.g., viaexposure to cigarette smoke, ultraviolet light, certain mycotoxins, etc.). If, in spite of the presence ofp53 protein, a cell begins to divide uncontrollably following damage to its DNA, the p53 gene cancause apoptosis, which is also known as “programmed cell death” (to try to prevent tumors).When even slightly methylated (e.g., a single methyl molecular group attached to a cytosine base inthe p53 gene at a site adjacent to DNA damage), carcinogens such as those within cigarette smoke oraflatoxin  are  attracted  to  that  site  and  insert  themselves  between  adjacent  base  pairs  in  the  DNA,thereby  preventing  normal  DNA  repair.

The p53 proteinhas four domains, one of which (i.e., the core domain) binds to a specific sequence (recognition site)of the cell’s DNA, in order to prevent cell from dividing uncontrollably when the cell’s DNA has beendamaged  (e.g.,  via  exposure  to  cigarette  smoke,  ultraviolet  light,  or  other  carcinogen),  until  thedamage to that DNA can be repaired (also under the influence of the p53 protein).As the amount of DNA within a given (damaged) cell increases, the concentration of p53 proteinalso  increases.  Because  p53  protein  is  a  transcription  factor  (i.e.,  “reads”  DNA  to  determine  ifdamaged, then acts to control cell division, while p53 gene codes for production of more p53), p53 isvery efficient at preventing/inhibiting tumors.However, if the cell’s DNA cannot be repaired, the p53 protein can cause cell cycle arrest and/orapoptosis (“programmed cell death”) to prevent development of (cancerous) tumors.

Thegene coding for (more) production of PARP enzyme is “switched on” during times of stress to theorganism (e.g., during drought in a plant). PARP is cleaved (degraded) by caspases during apoptosis.During drought conditions, PARP levels in crop plants are often so high (due to overexpression ofPARP gene) that the plant’s yield is decreased versus what it otherwise would have been. Thus, oneway  that  scientists  are  working  to  engineer  drought-resistant  crop  plants  is  to  moderate  PARPproduction (e.g., via RNA interference) of PARP enzyme.PARP  enzyme  can  be  commercially  produced  (e.g.,  to  manufacture  certain  test  devices)  viagenetically engineered hamster cells grown in cell culture. This enzyme can be utilized by man inorder to determine/test if a given substance (e.g., industrial chemical) is carcinogenic to humans.PARP inhibitor pharmaceuticals have been shown to act against breast and ovarian cancers whenused in women with breast and ovarian cancers linked to BRCA mutations. That is because, followingDNA damage in human cells, two specific proteins (known as PARP 1 and PARP 2) initially “recruit”other particular protein molecules to repair the resultant DNA damage. However, if that DNA damageis to BRCA genes in DNA (i.e., associated with loss of BRCA proteins to cell), such mutations inBRCA genes often result in ineffective PARP repair of the cell’s damaged DNA, which increases therisk  for  that  cell  developing  certain  cancers  (e.g.,  cancers  of  the  breast  cells,  ovary  cells).Pharmaceutical inhibition of the cell’s PARP in such cases thereby prevents the repair of such cell’sdamaged DNA, leading to apoptosis (cell death) that—appropriately—prevents cell from becomingcancerous.See also Enzyme, Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), Ribose, Polymerase, Cell, Deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA),  DNA  repair,  Gene,  Coding  sequence,  Express,  Expressivity,  RNA  interference  (RNAi),Apoptosis,  Abiotic  stresses,  Cell  culture,  Mammalian  cell  culture,  CHO  cells,  Carcinogen,  Cancer,Nuclear  matrix  proteins,  Genetic  engineering,  AMES  test,  Caspases,  Drought  tolerance,  Droughttolerance trait, BRCA 1 gene, BRCA genes, Olaparib.', 'PARP Inhibitors': 'Refers to either RNA interference of (excessive) PARP production in drought-stressed crop plants orto  PARP  inhibitor  pharmaceuticals  (e.g.,  which  have  been  shown  to  act  against  some  breast  andovarian cancers).For example, during 2014, the U.S. FDA approved for pharmaceutical use Lynparza (olaparib) asthe  first  poly  ADP-ribose  polymerase  (PARP)  inhibitor  for  patients  with  germline  mutations  inBRCA1/2  advanced  ovarian  cancer  who  have  had  three  or  more  lines  of  chemotherapy.

Those environmental factors include the following:Foods eaten/nutrients absorbed by the individual organism.The stress the individual is exposed to.Air and water pollution the individual is exposed to.Temperature and humidity the individual is exposed to.Geographical elevation the individual is exposed to.Bacteria the individual is exposed to. For example, when Rhizobium japonicum bacteria growin the soil near the roots of a soybean plant (Glycine max L.), that causes certain specificgenes in the soybean plant to be expressed (i.e., “turned on”) so that soybean plant’s rootsbecome more hospitable as a “home” for those R. japonicum bacteria to live symbiotically (innodules on the roots) with the soybean plant.See also Nutraceuticals, Crop biologicals, Pharmacokinetics, Genetics, Pharmacology,Pharmacogenetics,  Absorption,  Metabolism,  SNP,  Allele,  Haplotype,  Haptoglobin,  Rhizobium(bacteria), Nodulation, Symbiotic, Central dogma (new), Acclimatization.', 'Pharmacogenetics': 'A  branch  of  pharmacokinetics  that  deals  with  the  reactions  between  drugs,  free  radicals,nutraceuticals, or extracted/synthetic food ingredients, and specific individuals due to the genetics ofthose individuals.The subgroup of all those individuals whose DNA causes their bodies to respond in a specific wayto a given drug or synthetic food ingredient is known as a HAPLOTYPE. For example, one haplotype(subgroup)  of  pediatric  leukemia  patients  suffers  severe  and  life-threatening  reactions  to  somecommonly used leukemia treatment drugs, due to the variation (i.e., SNP) in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene (allele) in their genome.Another  example  is  the  2010  discovery  by  John  Bartlett  that  a  SNP  known  as  CEP17,  found  onchromosome 17 in the DNA of one haplotype of women, is a “highly significant indicator” that breastcancer  tumors  in  those  women  will  respond  to  the  class  of  chemo-therapy  drugs  known  asanthracyclines (i.e., antitumor antibiotics which interfere with enzymes involved in DNA replication).Another example is that consumption of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug gefinitib (Iressa) worksto control tumors of non-small-cell lung cancer in people who possess a mutation (i.e., the SNP whichcodes for the epidermal growth factor receptor) within their lung cancer tumors.Another example is that consumption of the pharmaceuticals tolbutamide, warfarin, or phenytoincan be riskier for people who possess a mutation (i.e., an SNP which codes for less or no expression ofCYP2C9) within their liver tissue. That is because the CYP269 enzyme causes rapid metabolism oftolbutamide, warfarin, phenytoin (and some other pharmaceuticals), so the “typical dose” could resultin  higher-than-expected  bloodstream  levels  of  those  pharmaceuticals  in  people  possessing  thatparticular SNP.Another  example  is  that  consumption  of  plant  sterols  helps  to  lower  blood  cholesterol  levels  ofpeople in some haplotypes but is ineffective in people of other haplotypes.Another  example  is  that  consumption  of  sodium-containing  food  ingredients  tends  to  causedangerous increase in blood pressure (hypertension) among the African-American people living in theUnited States, more often than among other ethnic groups living in the United States.See also Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacogenomics, Genetics, Pharmacology, Absorption, Metabolism,Haplotype, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Gene,  Mutation,  SNP,  Allele,  Coding  sequence,  Express,Expressivity, Enzyme, Cytochrome P450 (CYP), Cancer, Haptoglobin, Transversion, Fluorescence insitu  hybridization  (FISH),  Tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI),  Receptors,  Epidermal  growth  factorreceptor  (EGF),  Chromosomes,  Chemotherapy,  Replication  (of  DNA),  Antibiotic,  Copy  numbervariation, Immune profiling, Nutraceuticals, Streols.', 'Pharmacogenomics': 'A  branch  of  pharmacokinetics  that  deals  with  the  biological  impacts  of  pharmaceuticals,nutraceuticals,  or  extracted/synthetic  food  ingredients,  and  the  specific  differences inresponse/reaction of living structures (e.g., tissues, organs, etc.) due to different genomes (DNA) ofthose individual organisms that consume those pharmaceuticals or food ingredients.The subgroup consisting of all those individuals whose genome (DNA) causes their body to respondin a specific way to a given pharmaceutical, free radical, or synthetic food ingredient is known as aHAPLOTYPE.

That is due to the fact that different gene(s) within their genomes (DNA)cause  synthesis  of  certain  different  proteins  (generally  enzymes),  which  thereby  cause  thetissues/bodies of those individuals/ethnic minorities to react differently to specific pharmaceuticals orfood ingredients in terms of the following:Absorption: Transport of the drug (pharmaceutical) or food ingredient into the bloodstream(e.g., from the intestinal tract, in the case of food ingredients or orally administered drugs).Distribution:  Initial  physical  disposition/behavior  of  the  substance  in  the  body  after  thesubstance enters the body tissues.

Monogastric  animals  (e.g.,  swine,poultry)  cannot  digest  and  utilize  the  phosphorous  within  phytate,  because  they  lack  the  enzymeknown  as  phytase  in  their  digestive  system,  so  that  phosphorus  (phytate)  is  excreted  into  theenvironment. When phytase enzyme is present in the ration of a monogastric animal, at a high enoughlevel,  the  monogastric  animal  is  then  able  to  digest  the  phytate  (thereby  “releasing”  most  of  thatphosphorus for absorption by the body of the animal).However,  the  (cleaved-off,  “free”  inositol)  that  was  “liberated”  from  (six  phosphate  atoms  permolecule of phytate) than can quickly chelate (i.e., “combine” with) other minerals in the feed ration(e.g., iron, calcium, zinc, etc.) and the combination is excreted in the animal’s wastes.Thus, low-phytate crop varieties (i.e., containing inherently smaller amounts of inositol) are lesslikely  to  chelate  important  dietary  minerals  such  as  iron  (which  can  exacerbate  malnutrition  intypically iron-poor diets such as in developing countries where adequate iron content/iron fortificationof human diets is not common).In adult humans (e.g., those past childbearing age), the chelating (“combining”-with) property ofthe phytate-source inositol causes it to act as a beneficial antioxidant in the human body, which canhelp  to  protect  against  certain  cancers  (e.g.,  prostate  cancer).

If the ends of the rope are then joined or tiedtogether  and  the  resultant  circle  of  rope  is  again  wound  in  the  same  direction  as  the  winding  thatproduced  the  rope  in  the  first  place,  supercoils  will  be  formed  and  the  rope  will  become  a  muchthicker (supercoiled) but shorter piece of rope.

Because most pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow best at a neutral pH(i.e., neither acidic nor base/caustic), the growth rates of pathogens are thereby inhibited. That enablesthe Bifidus bacteria to “crowd out” enteric pathogens, since Bifidus bacteria grow fast in the acidicenvironment created by those organic acids.For example, the bacterial strain Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis has been shown to increasethe vaso-active intestinal peptide levels within the human digestive system, which improves barrierintegrity function (e.g., prevent leaky gut syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.).Some people would include within the definition of probiotics compounds that (generally) act tostimulate  growth  of  beneficial  types  of  bacteria  within  the  digestive  system  of  animals  (e.g.,livestock).

During  their  synthesis  (after  emergingfrom cell’s ribosome), proteins may also be phosphorylated (i.e., a “phosphate group” is added to theprotein  molecule),  glycosylated  (i.e.,  one  or  more  oligosaccharides  is  added  onto  the  proteinmolecule), acetylated (i.e., one or more “acetyl groups” is added to the protein molecule), farnesylated(i.e., a “farnesyl group” is added to the protein molecule), ubiquinated (i.e., a ubiquitin “tag” is addedto  the  protein  molecule),  sulfated  (i.e.,  a  “sulfate  group”  is  added  to  the  protein  molecule),  orotherwise chemically modified.Proteins are the “workhorses” of living systems and include enzymes, antibodies, receptors, peptidehormones,  and  so  on.  Proteins  in  living  organisms  respond  to  changing  environmental  and  otherconditions by changing their location within cells, by getting cut into (specific) pieces, by changingwhich (other) molecules they will bind (adhere) to, and so on. All of the amino acids commonly foundin  (each  and  every  one  of  the)  proteins  have  an  asymmetric  carbon  atom,  except  the  amino  acidglycine. Thus, the protein is potentially chiral in nature.

Proven to occur spontaneously, by Christian B. Anfinsen duringthe 1960s; for protein molecules outside of living cells.This ability of polypeptide chains to fold into a great variety of topologies, combined with the largenumber of sequences (in the molecular chain) that can be derived from the 20 common amino acids inproteins, confers on protein molecules their great powers of recognition and selectivity. How a proteinfolds up determines its chemical function.During the 1990s, it was discovered that inside living cells, “chaperone” molecules are needed forproper  protein  folding  to  occur.  These  chaperones  are  protein  molecules  (e.g.,  certain  heat-shockproteins)  that  form  a  loosely  bound  complex  to  suppress  incorrect  protein  folding  as  the  proteinmolecule is emerging from the cell’s ribosome, so protein folding is both complete and correct assoon as the newly formed protein molecule is released from the cell’s ribosome.Some diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) can be caused by large amounts of mis-folded proteins.See  also  Amino  acid,  Protein,  Polypeptide  (protein),  Ribosomes,  Chaperones,  Prion,  Absoluteconfiguration, Conformation, Enzyme, Protein structure, Alzheimer’s disease, Rapid protein foldingassay, Unfoldases.', 'Protein Inclusion Bodies': 'See Refractile bodies (RB).', 'Protein Interaction Analysis': 'Refers  to  a  number  of  different  analyses/technologies  utilized  to  determine  if  a  given  (e.g.,“unknown”) protein molecule interacts with a protein molecule whose function is already known (e.g.,from previous research, its use as a pharmaceutical, etc.).

Some  (relatively  rare)  receptors  arelocated inside the cell’s plasma membrane (e.g., free-floating receptor for Retin-A). Both (membrane,internal) types of receptors are a functional part of information transmission (i.e., signaling) to thecell. A general overview is that once bound, both the receptor and its “bound entity” as a complex isinternalized by the cell via a process called endocytosis, in which the cell membrane in the vicinity ofthe bound complex invaginates. This process forms a membrane “bubble” on the inside of the cell,which then pinches off to form an endocytic vesicle. The receptor then is released from its boundentity by cleavage in the cell’s lysosomes. It is recycled (returned) to the surface of the cell (e.g., lowdensity  lipoprotein  receptors).  In  some  cases  the  receptor,  along  with  its  bound  molecule,  may  bedegraded by the powerful hydro-lytic enzymes found in the cell’s lysosomes (e.g., insulin receptors,EGF  receptors,  and  nerve  growth  factor  receptors).  Endocytosis  (internalization  of  receptors  andbound  ligand  such  as  a  hormone)  removes  hormones  from  the  circulation  and  makes  the  celltemporarily less responsive to them because of the decrease in the number of receptors on the surfaceof the cell. Hence the cell is able to respond (to new signal). A receptor may be thought of as a butlerwho allows guests (in this case, molecules that bind specifically to the receptor) to enter the house(cell) and who accompanies them as they enter.Another mode of “reception” occurs when, following binding, a transmembrane protein (e.g., one ofthe G proteins) activates the portion of the transmembrane (i.e., through the cell membrane) proteinlying inside the cell. That “activation” causes an effector inside cell to produce a “signal” chemicalinside the cell which causes the cell’s nucleus (via gene expression) to react to the original externalchemical signal (that bound itself to the receptor portion of the transmembrane protein).

The refractile bodies function as a sort of natural storage device forthe microorganism. They are called refractile bodies because their greater density (than the rest of themicroorganism’s body mass) causes light to be refracted (bent) when it is passed through them. Thisbending of light causes the appearance of very bright and dark areas around the refractile body andmakes them visible under a microscope.Relatively  rare  in  natural  occurrence,  refractile  bodies  can  be  induced  (i.e.,  caused  to  occur)  inprocaryotes  (e.g.,  bacteria)  when  the  procaryotes  are  genetically  engineered  to  produce  eucaryotic(e.g.,  mammal)  proteins.  The  proteins  are  stored  in  refractile  bodies.  For  example,  the  E.  colibacterium can be genetically engineered to produce bovine somatotropin (BST, a cow hormone) whichis  stored  within  refractile  bodies  in  the  bacterium.  After  some  time  of  growth  when  a  significantamount  of  BST  has  been  synthesized  the  E.  coli  cells  are  disrupted  (i.e.,  broken  open),  and  therefractile bodies are removed by centrifugation and washed. They are then dissolved in appropriatesolutions  to  release  the  protein  molecules.  This  step  denatures  (unfolds,  inactivates)  the  BSTmolecules and they are refolded to their native conformation (i.e., restored to the natural conformationfound within the cow) in order to regain their natural activity. The protein is then formulated in such away as to be commercially viable as a biopharmaceutical.Refractile  bodies  are  also  known  as  inclusion  bodies,  protein  inclusion  bodies,  and  refractileinclusions.

There  exist  two  major  types  of  regulatory  enzymes:  (1)covalently modulated enzymes and (2) allosteric enzymes.Covalently modulated enzymes are enzymes that can be inter-converted between active and inactive(or less active) forms by the covalent attachment (or removal) of a modulating metabolite by otherenzymes.  Hence  the  activity  of  one  enzyme  can,  under  certain  conditions,  be  regulated  by  otherenzymes.  Glycogen  phosphorylase,  an  oligomeric  protein  with  four  major  subunits  (tetramer),  is  aclassic  example  of  a  covalently  modulated  enzyme.  The  enzyme  occurs  in  two  forms:  (1)phosphorylase a, the more active form and (2) phosphorylase b, the less active form. In order for theenzyme to possess maximal catalytic activity (i.e., be phosphorylase a) certain serine residue on allfour  subunits  must  have  a  phosphate  covalently  attached.  If,  due  to  other  regulatory  signals  it  hasreceived, the enzyme phosphorylase phosphatase hydrolytically cleaves and removes the phosphategroup from the four subunits, the tetramer dissociates into the inactive (or much less active) dimer,phosphorylase b. Another enzyme, phosphorylase kinase, is able to rephosphorylate the four specificserine residues of the four subunits at the expense of ATP and regenerate the active phosphorylase atetramer.Allosteric enzymes are enzymes that possess a special site on their surfaces that is distinct from theenzyme’s  catalytic  site  and  to  which  specific  metabolites  (called  effectors  or  modulators)  arereversibly  and  noncovalently  bound.  The  allosteric-binding  site  is  as  specific  for  a  particularmetabolite as is the catalytic site, but it cannot catalyze a reaction, only bind the effector. The bindingof the effector causes a conformation change in the enzyme such that its catalytic activity is impairedor  stopped.  Allosteric  enzymes  are  normally  the  first  enzymes  in,  or  are  near  the  beginning  of,  amultienzyme system. The very last product produced by the multienzyme system (the end product)may act as a specific inhibitor of the allosteric enzyme by binding to that enzyme’s allosteric site. Thebinding consequently causes a conformation change to occur in the enzyme, which inactivates it. Aclassic  example  of  an  allosteric  enzyme  in  a  multienzyme  sequence  is  the  enzyme  L-threoninedehydratase, which is the initial enzyme in the enzyme sequence that catalyzes the conversion of Lthreonine to  L-isoleucine. This reaction occurs in five enzyme-catalyzed steps. The end product,  Lisoleucine, strongly inhibits L-threonine dehydratase, the first enzyme in the five-enzyme sequence.No other intermediate in the sequence is able to inhibit the enzyme. This kind of repression is calledfeedback or end-product inhibition. It should be noted that allosteric control may be negative (as inthe  example  earlier)  or  positive.  In  positive  control  the  effector  binds  to  an  allosteric  site  andstimulates the activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, some allosteric enzymes respond to two or morespecific  modulators  with  each  modulator  having  its  own  specific  binding  site  on  the  enzyme.  Anallosteric  enzyme  that  has  only  one  specific  modulator  is  called  monovalent  whereas  an  enzymeresponding  to  two  or  more  specific  modulators  is  called  polyvalent.  Combinations  of  the  previouspossibilities  could  lead  to  very  fine  tuning  of  the  enzymes  involved  in  the  synthesis  and/ordegradation of metabolites. Note that in the two examples earlier, the common denominator is thestructural  change  that  occurs  upon  execution  of  the  mechanism.

Absence of regulatory Tcells  has  been  shown  to  lead  to  some  autoimmune  diseases  (e.g.,  immune  dysregulation,polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome—also known as IPEX).Recent  research  indicates  that  some  cancer  tumors  can  “recruit”  regulatory  T  cells  to  leave  thelymph nodes in order to come and protect those tumors from being destroyed by the body’s immunesystem.

By prior insertion into that cell ofa gene (e.g., which causes bioluminescence or a certain chemical to be produced by the cell whensignal transduction has taken place), that cell “reports” (when a candidate drug has had the desiredeffect on the cell) by producing the bioluminescence or chemical (coded for by the reporter gene)which can be rapidly detected by the researcher (e.g., via light sensors or biosensors placed adjacent tothe cell).Another example is use of (inserted) lux gene as a reporter gene. The lux gene, which codes for thebioluminescent lux protein (a luminophore) can be inserted into the DNA of certain bacteria speciesthat  can  be  genetically  engineered  to  biodegrade  diesel  fuel  spilled  in  soil.

That introduction can be done either by physical insertion of the dsRNA(e.g., via spherical nucleic acids, etc.), cellular uptake from bloodstream (e.g., when manmade dsRNAis placed inside lipidoid nanoparticles, etc.) by genetic engineering of the organism so the organism’scell(s)  themselves  produce  that  (new)  dsRNA,  by  pest  organisms  consuming  such  geneticallyengineered crop plants, etc. For example, genetic engineers can utilize T7 RNA polymerase to causethe production of such dsRNA within living cells.Viral  infection  (i.e.,  insertion  of  viral  dsRNA)  and  also  micro-RNAs  can  also  cause  RNAinterference. For example, the fungus-like pathogenic organisms (oomycetes) known as Phythophtoraattack  numerous  plant  species  via  insertion  of  effectors  (a  class  of  essential  virulence  proteinsproduced  by  a  broad  range  of  pathogens)  that  disable  the  immune  systems  of  the  plants  via  RNAinterference.If those dsRNAs are relatively long, they are cleaved (cut) by enzymes known as dimeric RNase IIIribonucleases  (also  called  dicer  enzymes)  into  segments  approximately  19–21  bp  (base  pairs)  inlength; called siRNAs (short interfering RNAs or small interfering RNAs). That siRNA (i.e., specificto  a  selected  gene’s  mRNA)  causes  specific  cellular  “cutting  enzymes”  in  RISC  (RNA-inducedsilencing complex) to adhere to the transcribed-from-gene mRNA which the dsRNA was chosen to bespecific  to.  Those  “cutting  enzymes”  cut-up  and  mark  for  destruction  the  transcribed-from-genemRNA, thereby negating the effects of that gene. That effect is known as gene silencing, and it canpersist even in the (first generation) off-spring of that affected organism.Thus,  RNAi  is  one  methodology  which  can  be  utilized  by  scientists  to  cause  genesilencing/knockout. During 2002, Thomas A. Rosenquist and Gregory J. Hannon created “knockdown”mice  via  genetic  engineering  so  those  mice  (continually)  produced  the  dsRNA  which  silenced  aselected  gene.

It occurswhen the body’s immune system overresponds to an infection (e.g., by gram-negative bacteria), mostoften in which release of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) occurs.For  unknown  reason(s),  sepsis  usually  occurs  when  the  applicable  immune  system  cells  (e.g.,macrophages, etc.) overproduce numerous inflammatory and signaling agents (e.g., cytokines), whichresult in the body’s blood vessels becoming slack and permeable (thereby allowing plasma from theblood to “leak” out into surrounding tissues). That reduces blood pressure, and the nonplasma bloodcomponents  begin  to  form  clots  in  the  body’s  smallest  blood  vessels  (which  results  in  inadequateoxygen supply reaching the body’s organs). With time, the kidneys and other organs fail, the heart’selectrical activity becomes erratic, and death often results. Even if they survive, patients often haveblindness or their limbs must be amputated.In some cases of pneumonia, the infecting bacteria activate an F-box protein known as Fbxo3  toform a molecular complex that degrades another protein called Fbxl2 that is needed to suppress thebody’s  inflammatory  response.  If  that  occurs,  the  result  is  a  harmfully  overactive  inflammatoryresponse that can cause further damage of the lung tissue, multiple-organ failure, and septic shock(sepsis).

For example, G-proteins (which are embedded in the surface membrane ofcertain  cells,  but  extend  through  to  outside  and  inside  of  the  membrane)  accomplish  signaltransduction. When a hormone, drug, neurotransmitter, or other signal chemical binds (i.e., “docks”)to the receptor (on the exterior of the cell’s plasma membrane), the receptor activates the G-protein,which causes an effector inside cell to produce a “signal” chemical inside cell, which causes the cellto  react  to  the  original  external  chemical  signal  received.

Because  those“GROUPINGS OF SNPs” are linked (i.e., tend to “travel together” AS A GROUP within thegenetics of a given population), they can collectively confer a given “multiple SNP trait” toan  identifiable  subpopulation  of  individuals.  For  example,  the  pharmaceuticalsacetaminophen, aspirin, and Valium remain in the bodies of women (who constitute a haplotype  for  that  pharmacogenomic  trait)  longer  than  in  men.

Their total blood serum cholesteroland LDLP levels decreased by more than 10%, in a short time.During  2001,  the  United  States’  FDA  approved  a  (label)  health  claim  that  associates  theconsumption of plant sterols with reduced blood cholesterol content and with reduced CHD.Some of the sterols known to impart health benefits when consumed by humans include β-sitosterol(beta-sitsterol) and squalene.Research published in 2002 by Dr. Leon Simons et al. reported that when such sterols are consumedwhile the humans are also taking relevant statin pharmaceuticals, the beneficial impact on their LDLPlevels was more than the impact of either one alone (i.e., the beneficial impacts are additive).

They  are  proteins  made  by  many  organisms’  (plant,  bacteria,  and  mammal)cells when those cells are stressed by environmental conditions such as certain chemicals, pathogens,or heat. Among other functions, HSPs act to chaperone irreparably misfolded/abnormal proteins out ofcells.HSPs  also  function  as  molecular  chaperones  to  protect  protein  molecules  from  foldingprematurely/incorrectly (within the cells they are produced in).When  corn/maize  (Zea  mays  L.)  is  stressed  during  its  growing  season  by  high  nighttimetemperatures, that plant switches from its normal production of (“immune system” defense) chitinaseto production of heat-shock (i.e., stress) proteins, instead.Stress  proteins  are  also  produced  by  tuberculosis  and  leprosy  bacteria  after  these  bacteria  haveinvaded (i.e., infected) cells in the human body, in an attempt by those bacteria to mimic the stressproteins that (mammal) cells would normally manufacture to repair damage done to the (mammal)cells.  This  mimicry  makes  it  more  difficult  for  the  immune  system  to  recognize  and  attack  thosepathogenic bacteria (and/or repair misshaped protein molecules in the body’s cells).Similarly, production of stress proteins helps some types of cancer cells to avoid being attacked bythe  immune  system.  Because  consumption  of  genistein  by  humans  causes  a  reduction  in  theproduction  of  stress  proteins,  genistein  may  thereby  help  the  human  immune  system  to  destroycancerous cells.In 1996, Richard I.

They discovered that it functioned just like other phiX174 bacteriophages.or2.  To add new function(s) to existing living organisms. For example during 2011, scientists inColombia created a modular (made from two different genetically modified E. coli bacteria)“detect,  amplify  and  alert”  system,  to  function  as  a  defense  aid  for  coffee  plants  againstpathogenic  fungi.  The  modular  system’s  first  bacteria  detects  chitin  (a  polysaccharidecompound present in fungal cell walls) and as a result it synthesizes chitinase plus a signalingmolecule that triggers the second bacteria to produce a second signaling molecule known assalicylic acid (i.e., to amplify the initial chitin-presence signal), and thereby alerts the coffeeplant  via  that  salicylic  acid  stimulating  within  the  plant  a  hypersensitive  response  againstfungal  infection.  The  salicylic  acid  also  acts  to  control  the  (synthetic  biology)  modularsystem’s E. coli population, because too high salicylic acid concentration is toxic to those twobacteria.3.  To model, design, and build synthetic gene “circuits” and other biomolecular components inorder to “rewire” cells/organisms for (useful to man) purposes.For example, during 2014 George Church and colleagues modified E. coli bacteria so that only thosebacteria  producing  a  particular  bio-based  industrial  chemical  (selected  by  George  Church)proliferated, because their DNA had been modified so that antibiotic-resistant genes were activated,but  only  in  the  presence  of  that  selected  industrial  chemical,  in  subsequent  culture  medium  thatcontained relevant antibiotic. Only the most productive E. coli cells generate enough of the industrialchemical to be totally resistant to the antibiotic and survive to the next round of (directed) evolution.When Dr. Church and his colleagues subsequently exposed the E. coli bacteria to an antibiotic thatkilled  all  but  the  most  efficient  of  those  (industrial)  chemical-producing  bacteria,  the  bacterialproduction  of  that  industrial  chemical  increased  30-fold.  When  it  is  thus  utilized  to  improve  anorganism’s output (e.g., of an industrial chemical) against a self-sought (by the living organism acrossmultiple  generations)  goal,  this  particular  application  of  synthetic  biology  is  known  as  directedevolution.During 1990, Peter G. Schultz had developed cells whose DNA coded for amino acids additional tothe  20  naturally  occurring  amino  acids.  During  the  late  1990s,  Drew  Endy  developed  numerousdistinct segments of DNA which both code for specific desired proteins and also work well together(when  both  of  those  segments  are  inserted  into  a  given  cell  to  each  do  a  specific  task).

One example of this is the production of stress proteins or pathogenesis-relatedproteins when certain plants are attacked by certain pathogens. Via such SAR response triggered bylow-level fungal or viral infection, many plants successfully resist fungal/bacterial/viral attacks.In  1998,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  approved  one  herbicide  (COBRA™owned by Valent Corp.), whose active ingredient is the chemical LACTOFIN, to be applied to soybeanplants “at or near bloom stage” in order to trigger SAR against white mold disease.

During 2012, Sadia Mohsin extracted adult stemcells  from  elderly  people’s  hearts  (who  were  suffering  from  heart  disease)  and  modified  thoseextracted stem cells in the laboratory using PIM-1 (a protein that promotes cell survival and growth)which enhanced activity of their telomerase.

This “shortening” process serves to limit the lifetime (i.e., number of replications) of those(noncancerous, nonzygote, nonhybridoma, etc.) cells, so shorter telomeres are indicative of a shorterlifespan for the organism too. Related to that, shorter telomeres are also indicative of a greater chancefor  the  organism  getting  lung  disease,  bone  marrow  failure,  liver  disease,  or  skin  disease.  Recentresearch indicates that adequate dietary consumption of n-3 (“omega-3”) fatty acids can slow/decreasethis telomere-shortening process.In certain rare people possessing a gene for a more active telomerase, that “lifetime” is extended bya limited amount of lengthening of the telomeres.

For  example,  some  rare  humans  can  tolerate  eating  certain  poisonousmushrooms (which sicken or kill all other humans that consume those particular mushroom species).Some humans can tolerate intimate exposure to urushiol oil toxin in poison oak (Rhus diversiloba),which harms other humans (e.g., causes oozing, itching rash, etc.).During  2001,  scientists  identified  a  human  genetic  variation  which  makes  some  cancer  patientsapproximately seven times more likely to have a toxic reaction to the common chemotherapy drugirinotecan used to treat colorectal cancer.Some rare humans are unable to degrade (breakdown) pyrimidine-containing pharmaceuticals, dueto those humans’ lack of a gene coding for production in their body of a specific pyrimidine-degradingenzyme  (abbreviated  DHPDH).  The  goal  of  toxicogenomics  in  that  case  is  to  avoid  administeringpyrimidine-containing  pharmaceuticals  (e.g.,  the  anticancer  drug  5-fluorouracil)  to  those  particularhumans. One way to accomplish that goal would be via genetic testing, to determine which individualslack the gene for DHPDH before any pyrimidine-containing pharmaceuticals are administered.During  2001,  Fred  Gould,  David  Heckel,  and  Linda  Gahan  showed  that  a  rare,  recessive  gene(allele) known as BtR-4 could confer (to tobacco budworms possessing two copies of that particulargene) resistance to at least some of the “cry” proteins (which kill all other tobacco budworms thatconsume those “cry proteins”).The subgroup of all those individuals whose DNA (genome) causes their bodies to resist the effectsof a given toxin, or be unable to degrade other toxin(s), is known as a HAPLOTYPE.

The metabolic fateof the labeled metabolite can then be traced in intact organisms. That is, one is able to ascertain where(in what kind of structure) the metabolite ends up as well as the transformation products (intermediatemolecules) which were involved in its formation. Certain atoms of a given metabolite are labeled.This is done by substituting radioactive isotopes for the atom in question. Because an atom is replacedby  an  isotope,  the  metabolite  as  a  whole  is  chemically  and  biologically  indistinguishable  from  itsnormal analogue. The presence of the isotope allows the metabolite and its transformation products tobe detected and measured. Without this technique, many aspects of metabolism could not have beenstudied.

That plant was then propagated via straightforwardbreeding to yield seeds still sown today.Many  years  ago,  some  other  crops  similarly  were  given  new  traits  (e.g.,  herbicide  tolerance,compositional  improvements,  etc.)  via  MUTATION  BREEDING  (i.e.,  soaking  seeds  or  pollen  inmutation-causing  chemicals  such  as  colchicine,  or  bombardment  of  seeds  by  ionizing  radiation  tocause random genetic mutations, followed by grow out and selection of the particular mutation desiredsuch as herbicide tolerance—as described above).Other crops were given new traits via crossing them with related wild plants, which occasionallyresulted in extremely high levels of natural toxicants in those plants/seeds (e.g., solanine, psoralene,etc.).Still others were given new traits via wide-crossing them with other domesticated species (e.g., thetangelo is a hybrid of the grapefruit and the tangerine).The United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all new crop plants similarly(e.g.,  also  requires  testing  of  plants  produced  via  “traditional  breeding  methods”  for  the  potentialpresence  of  introduced  or  increased  natural  toxicants).

TGF-betahas  shown  immunosuppressive  activity  (i.e.,  it  suppresses  the  immune  system).  For  example,transforming growth factor-beta works together with osteoinductive factor to promote bone formationby first causing connective tissue cells to grow together to form a matrix of cartilage (e.g., across abone break) then bone cells slowly replace that cartilage. Research indicates that when injected (i.e.,in the form of a pharmaceutical), TGF-beta can inhibit ovarian cancer. An excess of TGF-beta tends toreduce the amount of muscle repair activity in the body.

See  alsoInternational Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), Quarantine pest, Introduction.', 'Trehalose': 'A disaccharide (simple sugar) that is naturally synthesized (i.e., “manufactured”) by many plants andanimals in response to the stresses of freezing, heating, or drying. That is because trehalose protectscertain  proteins  (needed  for  life)  and  prevents  loss  of  crucial  volatile  (i.e.,  easily  evaporated)compounds from organisms during those stressful (e.g., dry, frozen, or hot) conditions. Trehalose alsoprovides a source of quick energy after the stressful conditions have passed. That is why dried baker’syeast (which contains up to 20% trehalose by weight) can be stored in its dry state for many years, yetquickly leavens bread dough within minutes of being rehydrated (i.e., rewetted).Trehalose accomplishes this protection by forming a nonhygro scopic “glass” on the surfaces ofcells and large molecules. It immobilizes and stabilizes large molecules (e.g., proteins) but still allowswater to diffuse out so complete drying can occur. Thus, trehalose holds potential as a food additive tokeep proteins (e.g., eggs) fresh in the dried form. In 1991, the United Kingdom approved trehalose foruse in food. Trehalose hydrolyzes (e.g., during digestion) into two molecules of glucose.Due  to  its  trehalose  content,  the  Resurrection  Plant  (also  known  as  Rose  of  Jericho)  can  be“resurrected” (after years in a state of total dessication) by rehydrating it.When larvae of the midge Polypedilum vanderplanki detect the water disappearing from the smallrock pools they live in, those larvae synthesize (i.e., manufacture) trehalose and utilize it to protecttheir body tissue as it dehydrates (e.g., during a drought period). When the pools later fill with wateragain, the larvae rehydrate and continue their development into adult midges.

More precisely called tumor necrosis factor-α, it is an adipokine (i.e.,protein  synthesized  by  adipose  cells  which  helps  regulate  the  immune  system)  that  has  shownpotential to combat (kill) malignant (cancer) tumors. TNF also can act to disrupt formation of the newvasculature (blood vessels) needed by the tumor for blood supply (e.g., when TNF is delivered in theform of a concentrated pharmaceutical via nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors).During certain infections such as tuberculosis (TB), synthesis of TNF by the immune system at firstrapidly  causes  macrophages  to  scavenge  and  kill  TB  bacteria.  However,  if  the  immune  systemproduces TNF in excess, that excess TNF forces the macrophages to die and expel their TB bacteriacaptives  alive.  Both  the  antibacterial  activity  inside  the  macrophages,  and  the  (later)  death  of  themacrophages,  are  resultant  from  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen  species  by  mitochondria  in  themacrophages.TNF was discovered to be 10,000 times more toxic in humans than in rodents, where it had beentested  for  toxicity  prior  to  human  clinical  tests.  This  example  illustrates  one  potential  pitfall  ofnontarget animal testing in that sometimes animal testing does not accurately reflect or foretell whatwill happen in humans.Another drawback to using TNF-α as a drug to combat human tumors is the fact that it is one of thesubstances released by the body in excess (in the disease rheumatoid arthritis) that destroys tissue inthe joints (TNF causes both inflammation and joint damage).When released as part of the AIDS (disease), TNF causes cachexia, which is a “wasting away” ofthe body due to the body’s reduced ability to process nutrients received via digestion.The  pharmaceuticals  known  as  Remicade™  (infliximab)  and  Humira™  (adalimumab)  aremonoclonal antibodies approved by the U.S. FDA as treatments to inhibit the structural damage (tobody joints) of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.The pharmaceutical known as Enbrel™ (etanercept) is a fusion protein approved by the U.S. FDAas a treatment to inhibit the structural damage (to body joints) of the autoimmune disease rheumatoidarthritis.Each  of  those  three  pharmaceuticals  specifically  block  TNF-α.

Genes within a cell’s DNA that code for (i.e., cause to be manufacturedin cell’s ribosomes) proteins that hold the cell’s growth in check. If these genes are damaged (e.g., byradiation, by a carcinogen, or by chance accident in normal cell division), they no longer hold cellgrowth in check and the cell becomes malignant (if the cell’s DNA also contains a gene called anoncogene). Oncogenes must be present for the cell to become malignant, but oncogenes cannot cause acell  to  become  malignant  until  a  tumor-suppressor  gene  is  damaged.  As  with  all  genes,  tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies (alleles, one from each parent) and either copy can codefor  the  proteins  necessary  for  cell  growth  control.  However,  an  organism  that  is  born  with  onedefective  copy  of  a  tumor-suppressor  gene  (or  in  whom  one  copy  is  damaged  early  in  life)  isespecially  prone  to  cancer  (malignancy).

The proteins aremoved by applying an electrical field in two distinct directions.The sample is moved through two different gels (i.e., two different dimensions). The initial gel hasa pH gradient that separates the different proteins based on their respective isoelectric points (i.e.,separated on the basis of the protein molecule’s charge).The  second  gel  (dimension)  the  sample  is  moved  through  is  a  gel  that  separates  the  proteinmolecules  based  on  their  individual  molecular  weights.  That  gel  acts  as  a  “molecular  sieve”  (i.e.,smaller proteins move faster—and farther—than larger proteins do through this gel; in a fixed amountof time).A fixed-time gel run (i.e., with appropriate gel and the appropriate electrical fields applied to thegel) leaves a scientist with as many as 1000 “spots” (of individual protein molecules) on the gel. Each“spot” is a collection of the molecules of one protein—from the original sample (mixture). To identifythe protein(s) in the “spots,” the scientist can:Stain them (e.g., with ethidium bromide, etc.), then illuminate them with a special (UV) lightand assesses the entire gel with an electronic image scanner (or he assesses it visually).Cut  out  each  spot  from  the  gel,  then  analyze  them  (e.g.,  via  use  of  MALDI-TOF  massspectrometer) to determine the identity of the protein in each spot.From the pattern (coupled with intensity) of the “spots,” two such gels could be utilized to:Confirm if two sample organisms were the same species/strain/variety.Determine the differences (in gene expression) between samples of diseased versus healthytissues.See also  Protein, Gel,  Electrophoresis,  Agarose,  Polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis (PAGE),  Page,Isoelectric point, Gene expression analysis, Proteomics, Molecular weight, Species, MALDI-TOF-MS,Isoelectric focusing (IEF), Protein solubilization, Molecular-weight size marker.', 'Two-Hybrid Systems': 'Refers to yeast or bacterial “systems” (test systems built by scientists) which are utilized to detectspecific protein–protein interactions (e.g., identification of the gene which codes for the protein whichis found to specifically interact with a known protein when the known protein is exposed to a samplecontaining numerous “unknown” proteins).Two-hybrid  systems  take  advantage  of  the  fact  that  certain  transcriptional  factors  possess  twodistinctly separate functional domains. One of those two domains must interact with a second domain(e.g., in fusion protein containing portion of known protein) in order to cause transcription (e.g., of theGAL4 gene in the yeast two-hybrid system).The  oldest  two-hybrid  system  is  that  utilizing  the  GAL4  transcriptional  activation  system  ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast.

Suchproteins are then broken down in cell’s proteasomes and their constituents recycled because they aredamaged or no longer needed by the body. The ubiquitin molecules are then available for reuse.Ubiquitin also similarly “tags” damaged chloroplasts in plants. A chloroplast can be damaged (i.e.,its  capacity  to  transfer  electrons  exceeded)  by  drought,  extreme  temperatures,  or  by  too  highirradiance  (sun  too  bright  for  that  plant),  resulting  in  the  generation  of  free  radicals  that  couldsubsequently damage DNA, lipids, proteins, and so on. Thus, rapid removal of such chloroplasts isrequired to protect the plant cells.Ubiquitin  can  also  sometimes  be  covalently  attached  to  DNA  or  its  associated  histones,  therebyresulting in an epigenetic change to thus impacted cells. That tagging/marking for destruction occursvia fusion of the ubiquitin to the relevant protein molecules, and those “tagged” protein molecules aresaid  to  have  been  ubiquitinated  or  ubiquitylated.  The  overall  ubiquitination  process  wasdiscovered/delineated  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  by  Irwin  Rose,  Aaron  Ciechanover,  and  AvramHershko.Ubiquitination is also critical in cell division processes, DNA repair processes, apoptosis, transportof certain proteins from a cell’s surface to the interior of cell, and protein synthesis processes.In some specific instances, the fusion of ubiquitin to certain protein molecules in cells causes that“partner  protein”  to  be  expressed  in  larger  amounts  than  previously.

The simple structure of viruses is theirmost  important  characteristic.  Most  viruses  consist  only  of  a  genetic  material—either  DNA(deoxyribonucleic  acid)  or  RNA  (ribonucleic  acid)—and  a  protein  coating.  This  (combination)material is categorized as a nucleoprotein.Some viruses also have membranous envelopes (coatings). They are able to “inject” their geneticmaterial into (host) cells because the internal pressure inside viruses is greater than inside the hostcells.Viruses are “alive” in that they can reproduce themselves—although only by taking over a cell’s“synthetic genetic machinery”—but they have none of the other characteristic of living organisms.After invading the cell(s) of an organism, viruses reprogram that cell to make it more conducive tovirus reproduction. For example, the adenovirus reprograms the cell after invading it, to grow larger insize and to be able take in more glucose (e.g., from nearby bloodstream). The reprogramming alsocauses the cell to increase its usage of the glucose taken in to create energy and facilitate the virus tobegin replicating inside the cell.Viruses  cause  a  large  variety  of  significant  diseases  in  plants  and  animals,  including  humans.Viruses can (e.g., as one part of the disease) cause gene silencing.In 1970, it was discovered that some RNA viruses (known as retroviruses) are able to utilize viralreverse transcriptase to cause (infected) cells to make DNA copies of those particular viruses. That“viral DNA” is then able to incorporate itself into the (infected) cell in a manner which transformsthat cell into a cancer cell. For example, infections by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and somehuman papilloma viruses can lead to cancer.Viruses present a philosophical problem to those who would speak of living and nonliving systemsbecause in and of itself a virus is not “alive” as we know life, but rather represents “life potential” or“symbiotic life.” See also Vaccinia, Nucleoproteins, Retroviruses, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Viraltransactivating  protein,  Gene  delivery,  Adenovirus,  Glucose,  Replicon,  NFκB,  Cancer,  Reversetranscriptases, Neoantigen, Kinesin, Viral surface proteins, dsRNA.', 'Viscosity': 'A measure of a liquid’s resistance to flow, as expressed in units called poise (P; g/cm/s).

Some compounds are vitamins for certain species of animals but are not for certain otherspecies.In general, a vitamin is an organic compound required in tiny amounts (for the optimal growth,proper biological functioning, and maintenance of health of an organism). For example, vitamin K isutilized  by  plants  in  the  photosynthesis  process.  For  example,  vitamin  D  enhances  an  animal’sabsorption and utilization of calcium (e.g., to build bones while growing).Vitamins  are  commonly  classified  into  two  categories,  the  fat  soluble  and  the  water  soluble.Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat soluble whereas vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and members of the vitaminB complex group are water soluble. In general, the vitamins play catalytic and regulatory roles in thebody’s  metabolism.  Among  the  water-soluble  vitamins,  the  B  vitamins  apparently  function  ascoenzymes  (nonprotein  parts  of  enzymes).  Vitamin  C’s  coenzyme  role,  if  any,  has  not  beenestablished. Part of the importance of vitamin C to the body may arise from its strong antioxidantaction. The functions of the fat-soluble vitamins are less well understood. Some of them, too, maycontribute to enzyme activity, and others are essential to the functioning of cellular membranes (onsurface of cells).Some vitamins act as transcription factors. Vitamin A is able to regulate the expression of certaingenes in the embryos of mammals via one of its metabolites, retinoic acid. Those embryo cells containnuclear receptors (which bring the retinoic acid “signal” from outside into the cell’s nucleus) on theircell membrane surface. The retinoic acid then (via the nuclear receptors) regulates the expression ofthe genes that cause embryonic cell differentiation into complex body structures, such as legs andarms, of the growing embryo.Vitamin D exerts its effects on genes via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor that binds tospecific  locations  on  the  cell’s  DNA  to  thereby  regulate  applicable  gene  expression.  During  2012,some researchers utilized receptor-binding mapping to link vitamin D deficiency to an increased riskfor  certain  cancers  (e.g.,  premenopausal  breast  cancer)  and  autoimmune  diseases  (e.g.,  rheumatoidarthritis,  multiple  sclerosis,  lupus,  etc.).

Those two effects thus lower the amount of “bad” cholesterol (i.e., LDLPcan lead to hardening/blockage of arteries) in the body and thereby lower the risk of coronary heartdisease (CHD).Additional to those two effects, water-soluble fiber also absorbs/binds bile acid and causes it to beexcreted  along  with  that  water-soluble  fiber.

One of those two domains must interact with a second domain(i.e.,  in  a  genetically  engineered  yeast-created  fusion  protein  containing  a  portion  of  the  “known”protein) in order to cause transcription of the GAL4 gene. GAL4 is required to initiate expression ofproteins that are central to galactose metabolism in that yeast.

Theprecision  agriculture  software  would  recommend  different  inputs/rates  for  a  yield  environmentlocated in a sandy soil, higher-elevation area of the farm field (e.g., more irrigation water applied,lower number of crop seeds planted per hectare, of a drought-tolerant crop variety).

The  difference  is  in  the  direction  of  the  double-helix  twist  (Z-DNA  is  analternative form of B-DNA in which the double helix unwinds to the left instead of the right). Z-DNAhas the most base pairs per turn (in the helix) and so has the least twisted structure; it is very “skinny”and its name is taken from the zigzag path that the sugar-phosphate “backbone” follows along thehelix. This is quite different from the smoothly curving path of the backbone of B-DNA. The Z-formof DNA has been found in polymers that have an alternating purine–pyrimidine sequence.One  possible  biological  importance  of  Z-DNA  is  that  it  is  much  more  stable  at  lower  saltconcentrations, and there is a possibility that the Z-DNA form (of DNA within cells) is the cause ofcertain diseases (e.g., certain cancers).During  2000,  Jonathan  Chaires/Waldemar  Priebe/John  Trent  showed  that  WP  900  (i.e.,  theenantiomer  of  daunorubicin,  a  natural  chemical  compound  that  inhibits  cancer)  binds  tightly  (andselectively) to a Z-DNA polymer.
