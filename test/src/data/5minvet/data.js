PATHOPHYSIOLOGY When the normal biotransformation mechanisms for detoxification (glucuronidation and sulfation) are saturated, cytochrome P450\u2013mediated oxidation produces a toxic metabolite ( N -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) that is electrophilic, conjugates with glutathione, and binds to sulfhydryl groups, leading to hepatic necrosis.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Nutritional deficiencies of glucose and/or sulfate. \u2022 Simultaneous administration of other glutathione-depressing drugs.", "Acidosis, Metabolic": " A process in the body that leads to a decrease in pH below the reference interval. A decline in blood pH is specifically termed acidemia. Associated with a decrease in plasma bicarb - onate concentration ( HCO 3 ; dogs, <18 mEq/L; cats, <16 mEq/L) and base excess (BE; \u20134 mmol/L) with a compensatory decrease in carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2 ). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Metabolic acidosis may develop either from a loss of HCO 3 (hyperchloremic acidosis) or a gain in acid (high anion gap [AG] acidosis). It is usually secondary to an accumulation of metabolically produced strong anions (strong ion gap or high anion gap acidosis), accumulation of weak acids (hyperphosphatemia), corrected hyperchloremia (hyperchloremic acidosis), or as a compensatory mechanism for respiratory alkalosis. \u2022 High anion gap acidosis\u2014increase in the concentration of other strong anions through addition (e.g., ethylene glycol toxicity), excessive production (e.g., lactate produced by prolonged anaerobic metabolism), or renal retention (e.g., renal failure) of strong anions other than Cl \u2013 causes metabolic acidosis without increasing Cl \u2013 concentration (so-called normochloremic or high AG metabolic acidosis). \u2022 Hyperphosphatemic acidosis\u2014increase in plasma weak acids (e.g., inorganic phosphate) is associated with metabolic acidosis and increased AG. At a pH of 7.4, a 1 mg/dL increase in phosphate concentration is associated with a 0.58 mEq/L decrease in HCO 3 and a 0.58 mEq/L increase in AG. Hyperphosphatemia commonly develops with decreased renal phosphorus excretion (e.g., renal failure, hypoparathyroidism), cellular lysis (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome, trauma, rhabdomyolysis), bone neoplasms (increased bone resorption), and hypervitaminosis D. \u2022 Hyperchloremic acidosis\u2014may be caused by Cl \u2013 retention (e.g., renal failure, renal tubular acidosis) that typically occurs in response to HCO 3 loss. Cl \u2013 and HCO 3 are reciprocally related; loss of HCO 3 generally results in retention of Cl \u2013 . Other mechanisms for hyper- chloremic acidosis include excessive loss of Na + relative to Cl \u2013 (e.g., diarrhea, Addison\u2019s) and administration of substances containing more Cl \u2013 than Na + compared with normal extracellular fluid composition (e.g., administration of KCl, 0.9% NaCl). Acidemia is usually not severe in patients with hyperchloremic acidosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014fall in pH results in increase in sympathetic discharge, but simultaneously causes decrease in responsiveness of cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle to effects of catecholamines. In mildly acidemic conditions (pH > 7.2), effects of increased sympathetic stimulation predominate and result in mild increase in heart rate and cardiac output. More severe acidemia (pH < 7.1), especially if acute, may decrease cardiac contractility and predispose heart to ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014increased hydrogen ion [H + ] stimulates peripheral and central chemoreceptors to increase alveolar ventilation; hyperventilation decreases PCO 2 , which counters effects of low plasma HCO 3 on pH. In dogs, a decrease of approximately 1 mmHg in PCO 2 is expected for each 1 mEq/L decrease in plasma HCO 3 . Little known about compensation in cats, but appears to be almost nonexistent. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014kidneys increase net acid excretion, primarily by increasing excretion of NH 4 + and Cl \u2013 . This compensatory mechanism not very effective in cats. SIGNALMENT Any breed, age, or sex of dog and cat. SIGNS Historical Findings Chronic disease processes that lead to metabolic acidosis (e.g., renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypoadrenocorticism), acute circulatory shock (hemorrhagic), exposure to toxins (e.g., ethylene glycol, salicylate, and paraldehyde), diarrhea, administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide).

Breed Predilections \u2022 Male Dalmatians have a higher risk of urethral obstruction because of the high incidence of urate urolithiasis. \u2022 German shepherds with pancreatic atrophy have a higher risk of mesenteric volvulus. Mean Age and Range Any Predominant Sex Male cats and dogs are at higher risk for urethral obstruction. SIGNS General Comments Clinical signs vary greatly, depending on type and severity of underlying disease. Historical Findings \u2022 Trembling, reluctance to move, inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, vocalizing, and abnormal postures (tucked up or praying position). \u2022 Question owner carefully to ascertain what system is affected; for example, melena with a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment may suggest GI mucosal ulceration. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Abdominal pain, splinting of abdominal musculature, gas- or fluid-filled abdominal organs, abdominal mass, ascites, pyrexia or hypothermia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. \u2022 Pain may be localizable to cranial, middle, or caudal abdomen. \u2022 Perform rectal examination to evaluate colon, pelvic bones, urethra, and prostate, as well as for presence of melena. \u2022 Rule out extra-abdominal causes of pain by careful palpation of kidneys and thoracolumbar vertebrae. \u2022 Pain associated with intervertebral disc disease often causes referred abdominal guarding and may be mistaken for true abdominal pain. Renal pain can be associated with pyelonephritis. CAUSES GI \u2022 Stomach\u2014gastritis, ulceration, perforation, foreign body, gastric dilatation-volvulus. \u2022 Intestine\u2014obstruction (foreign body, intussusception, mass, etc.), enteritis, ulcer- ation, perforation. \u2022 Rupture after obstruction, ulceration, or blunt or penetrating trauma, or due to tumor growth. \u2022 Vascular compromise from infarction, mesenteric volvulus, or torsion.

SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Acute diarrhea common, and usually self- limiting. Most animals stable, and require minimal diagnostics/treatment. \u2022 In patients that are unstable, with cardiovascular or metabolic compromise, more aggressive diagnostic and treatment approach is warranted. Historical Findings \u2022 Dietary history, dietary indiscretion, medication/toxin history, and general husbandry should be investigated. \u25e6 Special care should be taken to identify potentially contagious causes of diarrhea, and isolate these patients early. \u25e6 Patients that should be isolated for further diagnostics include unvaccinated, raw diet consumption, housing with many other cats/dogs, or multiple cats/ dogs from same household affected. \u2022 Varying activity levels can be seen, from normal to lethargic. \u2022 Character of diarrhea can help localize etiology: \u25e6 Small intestinal diarrhea characteristics: large volume, normal frequency, concurrent weight loss and/or vomiting. \u25e6 Melena, if present, points to gastric or upper small intestinal bleed. \u25e6 Steatorrhea, if present, points to maldigestive disorder like exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). \u25e6 Large intestinal diarrhea characteristics\u2014small volume, increased frequency, tenesmus, mucus, hematochezia.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Dietary\u2014abrupt diet change or dietary indiscretion. \u2022 Medications\u2014many medications can cause acute diarrhea (see Causes). \u2022 Infectious\u2014geographic distribution effect.", "Acute Kidney Injury": " \u2022 Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a continuum of renal injury, from mild, clinically inapparent, nephron loss to severe acute renal failure. \u2022 AKI is likely underrecognized. Any increase in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL from hydrated baseline is considered an AKI. \u2022 The spectrum of injury is highly variable and may range from mild subclinical to severe damage, requiring renal replacement therapy. \u2022 Patients with AKI have the potential for recovery of renal function. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 AKI may be categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal based on underlying etiology. Pre\u00ad and postrenal causes may progress to intrinsic renal damage. \u2022 Patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) are very predisposed to development of clinical AKI due to decreased renal reserve. Special care must be taken in patients with existing CKD to minimize predisposing factors: volume depletion, nephrotoxic medications, etc. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic. \u2022 Uremia may affect all body systems. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Prevalence is lower than for CKD. \u2022 Prevalence may increase in environments that support Leptospira . \u2022 Ureteral obstruction is most common cause of severe acute uremia in cats.

ARDS results from an overwhelming inflammatory reaction in the alveolocapillary membrane in response to a systemic or pulmonary inflammatory insult. The end result is increased vascular permeability leading to edema. \u2022 The 2012 Berlin Definition of ARDS defines three categories of severity based on PaO 2 /FiO 2 (PF) ratio and level of positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) employed during ventilation, with mild ARDS defined by a PF ratio of 200\u2013300 mmHg with PEEP \u22655 mmHg, moderate ARDS as a PF ratio of 100\u2013 200 mmHg with PEEP \u22655 mmHg, and severe ARDS as a PF ratio < 100 mmHg with PEEP \u22655 mmHg. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 ARDS is due to a diffuse inflammatory insult that causes widespread damage to alveolar endothelial and epithelial cells, resulting in thickening of the membrane and impaired gas exchange. This inflammatory insult can be triggered by primary pulmonary disease or it can be of nonpulmonary origin, and leads to exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic changes within the lung. \u2022 First, excessive accumulation and activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets in the pulmonary microvasculature lead to increased alveolar endothelial permeability. This causes protein\u2010rich edema fluid and inflammatory cells to leak into the interstitial and alveolar spaces. \u2022 Alveolar epithelial injury results from release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators from leukocytes and platelets. \u2022 Epithelial injury involves both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, and results in alveolar flooding and surfactant dysfunction. This causes collapse and consolidation of alveoli with development of severe hypoxemia, and hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar spaces. \u2022 Microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and release of endogenous vasoconstrictors lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension, which can lead to right\u2010sided heart failure. \u2022 Proliferation of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary fibrosis occurs in the late stages of ARDS. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014right\u2010sided heart failure secondary to pulmonary hyper \u00ad tension; hemodynamic compromise may be associated with aggressive mechanical ventilator settings. GENETICS Certain humans are more prone to developing ARDS than others due to specific gene polymorphisms. This has not been investigated in the veterinary population.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Vomiting is a reflex initiated by the vomiting center in the medulla, triggered by three major mechanisms\u2014gastric/duodenal mucosal irritation, gastric/duodenal distention, or the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ). \u2022 Mucosal irritation or gastric/duodenal distention signal the vomiting center via sympathetic and vagal afferent innervation. Anti-peristaltic waves force intestinal contents back to the duodenum, then distention becomes the main trigger for the vomiting reflex. \u2022 The CRTZ can directly trigger the vomiting center via receptor activation or vestibular input; known receptors are \u03b1 2 , D 2 , H1, M1, NK 1 , 5HT 3 . \u2022 Cerebral cortex and vestibular apparatus can also directly stimulate the vomiting center. \u2022 The vomiting center initiates an autonomic motor reaction via spinal nerves to diaphragmatic and abdominal muscles, and cranial nerves 5, 7, 9, 10, and 12 to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. \u2022 The reflex involves a deep breath, opening the upper esophageal sphincter, closing the glottis, strong diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle contractions, and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, leading to expulsion of contents. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014fluid losses can be significant, with progressive dehydration to hypovolemia; vagal stimulation can lead to bradycardia, and rarely syncope. \u2022 GI\u2014esophagitis. \u2022 Metabolic\u2014 vomiting of mixed small intestinal and gastric contents results in isotonic electrolyte losses; pyloric obstruction results in metabolic alkalosis; hypokalemia is common with concurrent hyporexia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.

Play Aggression (toward People) \u2022 Typically refers to cat who scratches and bites owners during play. \u2022 Not true aggression, but overzealous play without proper impulse control due to lack of training or proper intraspecific social feedback. \u2022 Cat\u2019s intent is not to harm the person. \u2022 Behavior encouraged and rewarded by owners through rough play with kitten; when larger and stronger, becomes perceived as aggression rather than overzealous play. Predatory Aggression (toward People or Other Animals) \u2022 Cats have innate drive to \u201chunt\u201d or show predation, which includes stalk, hide, and pounce. \u2022 Predatory behavior is not a direct function of hunger. \u2022 Typically stimulated by fast movements and can progress to cat hiding and waiting for animal or person to walk by. \u2022 Play is way for young cats to perfect predation skills; play aggression and predatory aggression may overlap. Redirected Aggression (toward People or Other Animals) \u2022 Cats who see, hear, or smell a trigger and direct aggressive behavior toward the closest bystander. \u2022 In some cases, one person or animal in the home becomes designated victim, and cat may bypass a nearby individual and attack preferred target. \u2022 Cats may remain aroused for 24\u201372 hours after triggering event. \u2022 Common triggers inciting redirected aggression are seeing another cat or wildlife outside or loud noises. Fear/Defensive Aggression (toward People or Other Animals) \u2022 Cat will show body postures indicative of fear/anxiety and may use aggression as strategy to manage that aversive situation. \u2022 Typical behaviors include combination of any of the following: hissing, spitting, piloerection, arched back, turning away, running away, cowering, rolling on back, and pawing (defensive) if cornered. \u2022 With learning and repetition, may display more offensive signs. Territorial Aggression (toward People or Other Animals) \u2022 Some cats, particularly males, show territorial behavior in domestic home settings due to perceived need to defend multiple resources (e.g., people, food, resting areas, feeding areas, elimination sites, etc.). \u2022 Territorial behaviors include marking with urine and/or feces, bunting (rubbing of cheeks on surfaces to deposit pheromones), and scratching (also deposits pheromones and leaves visual mark) that may be associated with aggression. \u2022 In severe cases, aggressor may seek out the other individual and attack. \u2022 Body posture with territorial aggression is assertive and confident. Pain Aggression (toward People and Animals) Cats in pain may show aggression (hiss, growl, scratch, bite) when physically handled or immediately prior to or after activity such as jumping on or off a piece of furniture. Maternal Aggression Female cat may show aggressive behavior toward individuals approaching her kittens. Impulse Control Aggression Cats who show intense aggressive responses to mild stimuli without much or any warning may have impulse control disorder arising from dysfunctional serotonin neural circuits. Frustration\u2010Induced Aggression (to People and Other Animals) Some cats with very outgoing, social personalities may exhibit aggression if restricted life indoors does not meet their behavioral needs. Contact\u2010Induced/Petting Aggression (toward People) \u2022 Cats may show early signs of aversion during petting and handling with ears going back and tail swishing. \u2022 If physical contact continues, they may bite. \u2022 Owners often miss early warning signs. \u2022 When cats groom one another, they typically limit grooming to the head region. \u2022 Some cats appear to be particularly sensitive to being stroked along the dorsum. Intercat Aggression within Home \u2022 After introducing new cat to home, 50% of cat owners report fighting (scratching and biting). \u2022 Number of cats, sex, and age are not significant factors in predicting which cats will show aggression toward each other. \u2022 Any of the above categories of aggression are all possibilities for fights between or among cats. \u2022 Fear/anxiety is most common cause of intraspecific aggression. \u2022 Learning\u2014consequences/outcome (reinforcement, punishment) further compound the problem. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Behavior problems are typically multifactorial in cause. Figure 1 illustrates some of the common components that need to be evaluated to accurately diagnose and treat aggression cases. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral\u2014vary with type of aggression, occur alone or in combination: tail swishing/ twitching, ears turned sideways or flattened, stiffening of shoulders/legs, crouching, dilation of pupils, hissing, spitting, growling, piloerection, staring, chasing, stalking, pawing, lunging. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014signs associated with sympathetic activation and hypothalamic\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal (HPA) activation. \u2022 Endocrine/ metabolic\u2014long\u2010term aggression associated with fear/stress/anxiety, symptoms associated with long\u2010term activation of HPA system. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014with chronic HPA stimulation: may see cat more prone to anorexia and GI ulcers; with acute fear aggression: evacuation of bowel and possible diarrhea; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) possible in chronic stress. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/ immune\u2014decreased immune response with chronic HPA stimulation; stress leukogram. \u2022 Both victim and aggressor may suffer injuries; with chronic activation of HPA, muscle wasting may occur. \u2022 Nervous\u2014increased reactivity up to 72 hours following aggressive event; may see increase in aggression with decreased provocation as synapses in amygdala become sensitized; in some animals may be associated with decreased serotonin, causing aggressive outbursts; may see ritualized motor patterns, shaking, or trembling. \u2022 Ophthalmic\u2014dilated pupils with sympathetic stimulation. \u2022 Renal/ urologic\u2014may see spraying or small amounts of urine on horizontal surfaces; stress may be contributor to feline interstitial cystitis. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea in acute cases or when stressed. \u2022 Skin/exocrine\u2014damage due to fights or to excessive grooming associated with fear/anxiety/distress. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Preliminary evidence that behavioral traits in cats vary by breed and sex. \u2022 Males more likely to show aggression toward other cats, while females more likely to show aggression toward owners. \u2022 Abyssinian, Russian blue, Somali, Siamese, and chinchilla breeds showed more aggression. \u2022 Maine Coon, ragdoll, and Scottish folds showed least aggressiveness. SIGNS \u2022 May appear at social maturity (2\u20134 years of age) except for play\u2010related and should occur in specific social contexts/interactions. If onset occurs in older cat, medical causes should be ruled out first. \u2022 General comments\u2014most owners able to detect overt signs of aggression (biting, hissing, growling), but may miss more subtle signs of aggression that typically occur between cats (staring) and resulting anxious behaviors that can result in aggression (meatloaf position, averting gaze, etc.). Videotapes of intercat interactions allow clinician to assess behavior. CAUSES \u2022 Underlying medical issues can cause aggression. \u2022 Temperament/behavior influenced by genetics, rearing, socialization, environment in which cat lives, and types of interactions cat has with people. ", "Aggression, Overview\u2014Dogs": " \u2022 Action by one dog directed against another organism with the result of limiting, depriving, or harming. Aggression refers to any behavior along an aggression continuum, from a stare to immobility (freeze), growl, snarl, lunge, air snap, single bite, multiple bite, multiple attacks, and chase and attack. \u2022 Numerous functional types have been posited. Here, aggression is classified on the basis of (1) affective aggression, (2) predatory aggression, and (3) play-related aggression. Affective states, such as fear and arousal, and motivational factors, such as hunger and sexual drive, influence the probability of overt aggression, such as biting. Affective aggression may be human-directed or dog-directed. Within these contexts, there may be additional specificity, such as human-directed aggression toward unfamiliar persons, or human-directed aggression toward familiar persons. Often dogs display aggression in a single context. \u2022 Human-directed aggression toward familiar persons in response to controlling gestures was historically called dominance aggression, although newer terminology, such as conflict aggression, may be used to avoid erroneous semantic assumptions inherent in the term \u201cdominance.\u201d \u2022 Human- or animal-directed aggression, generally toward unfamiliar individuals and specific to home location, is called territorial aggression. Location is commonly at door of entry, but may also involve defense of special favored locations such as beds. \u2022 Predatory aggression refers to behaviors associated with chasing and hunting prey. It is often considered nonaffective and may be socially facilitated by other dogs. Predatory behaviors may be triggered by movement or high-pitched sounds, and may be redirected to humans or objects. \u2022 Play-related aggression involves aggressive gestures, such as growling and biting, in the context of play and is commonly displayed toward other dogs or humans. It is often initiated by signs of play, such as the play bow. \u2022 In all cases, medical factors that might contribute to aggression (including pain) must be evaluated. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Affective aggression involves arousal of the sympathetic nervous system. Some pathologic conditions are associated with an increase in aggression because of CNS effects such as pain or irritability. \u2022 Abnormalities in the CNS serotonin neuro- transmitter system have been implicated in one type of impulsive human-directed aggression, colloquially called \u201crage,\u201d directed toward familiar persons and triggered by controlling gestures. \u2022 Aggression generally has a learned component, whereby dogs learn to use aggression to manage distance from fearful stimuli or control resources, as this behavior is often effective as a distance-increasing technique. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavior. \u2022 Other, if there is an underlying medical etiology. GENETICS \u2022 In some breeding programs, aggressive tendencies and bite styles have been selected for (or against). \u2022 Behavioral genetics is an active area of research, with several genes identified that may be associated with fear and aggression in dogs. \u2022 One study in the United States linked English springer spaniels that display human- directed dominance aggression to one breeding sire, implicating a heritable component. \u2022 One study of human-directed dominance aggression among English cocker spaniels reported that males were more aggressive than females, and dogs with solid coat color were more aggressive than those with parti coat color. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Reported problem by approximately 30% of owners. \u2022 Most common diagnostic category seen by board-certified veterinary behaviorists in North America. \u2022 According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4.7 million people bitten by dogs each year in United States, although this number considered an under- estimation as majority of dog bites not reported. \u2022 In United States, estimated that one in five of those bitten require medical attention for dog bite\u2013related injuries. \u2022 Among children and adults, males more likely than females to be bitten. \u2022 Based on emergency room data in United States, rate of dog bite\u2013related injuries highest for children aged 5\u20139 years. \u2022 In majority of cases, people are bitten by dogs that are known to them; this is not the case for dog injury\u2013related fatalities. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide SIGNALMENT Species Dog Breed Predispositions Any breed or breed mix. Mean Age and Range Any age, although some forms of aggression may arise more commonly at sexual or social maturity, while medical causes increasingly more likely in adult- or senior-onset aggression. Predominant Sex \u2022 Either sex. \u2022 Males\u2014intact or castrated, most commonly implicated in cases of human-directed \u201cdominance\u201d-type aggression. Intact males overrepresented in dog-bite fatalities, but covariables, such as owner management, are present. \u2022 Females\u2014spayed most commonly implicated in aggression to other female dogs in the home. In some studies, spayed females less likely than males to display human-directed aggression. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Any dog can display aggression. Many factors, including temperament, experience, and situational factors, influence propensity to bite. \u2022 Dogs may display behavioral signals as warnings, including immobility, growls, snarls, or air snaps, which may provide time to avoid overt aggression. These signs should not be punished, as this might decrease the probability of warning signs without affecting the underlying risk, or may further intensify the aggressive (defensive) response. Instead, the animal should be safely removed from the situation and the underlying triggers for the affective state addressed. Historical Findings \u2022 Variable. \u2022 Basis for risk analysis and details of treat- ment program. Important questions: Who/ what was the target? Who was present to manage the dog? How severe were the resulting injuries? What are the circumstances (including location, time) in which aggression occurred? Are there any reliable triggers for aggressive behavior? Abnormalities in mentation or awareness might indicate a medical cause. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Usually unremarkable. \u2022 Use extreme care when handling aggressive dogs. \u2022 A comfortable, well-fitting basket muzzle recommended prior to examination of any dog with history of human-directed aggression. Desensitize and countercondition to muzzle application and use. Basket-style muzzles allow dogs to pant. \u2022 Abnormalities on physical or neurologic examination may suggest organic disease process (e.g., neurologic, pain, blindness). Dogs can display aggression during preictal, ictal, or postictal periods. Dogs with underlying pain typically display defensive (bodyprotective) aggression. CAUSES \u2022 Part of normal range of behavior; strongly influenced by individual temperament, experience, early socialization (before 12 weeks), and other variables. \u2022 Harsh handling and confrontational responses can escalate aggression and should be avoided. \u2022 May be manifestation of organic condition, such as hepatic encephalopathy or pain. \u2022 In all cases, evaluate medical causes of aggression. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Inadequate socialization during canine critical period (3\u201312 weeks). \u2022 Traumatic/fearful/negative experience(s). \u2022 Predisposing environmental conditions\u2014 lack of training, inadequate restraint, harsh handling. \u2022 Inability of owner to safely confine or manage the dog in order to prevent future incidents. Helpful devices include barrier fence, muzzle, collar or head halter, leash. \u2022 Previous aggression/bite history (number of incidents, number of bites per incident, target, severity of injury); legal citation for biting. \u2022 Unpredictability of aggressive behaviors, lack of warning signals. \u2022 Presence of children, elderly people, or other humans or animals at high risk living in or visiting household.", "Alkaline Hyperphosphatasemia in Dogs": " Increase in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity above reference interval. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 ALPs are heterogeneous group of isoenzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters in extracellular space. \u2022 Membrane-bound enzymes present in liver, bone, placenta, intestine, and kidney. \u2022 Total serum ALP attributed to liver (L-ALP), bone (B-ALP), and glucocorticoid-induced (G-ALP) isoenzymes; proportion of each isoenzyme changes with age in normal dogs. \u2022 Serum ALP activity increases with cholestatic, necroinflammatory, and neoplastic injury; many hepatic and nonhepatic causes; affected dogs often asymptomatic. \u2022 Anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin) and steroids can induce L-ALP synthesis; steroids, inflammation, and chronic disease can induce G-ALP synthesis. \u2022 ALP has high sensitivity but poor specificity for hepatobiliary disease; reflects common induction of enzyme synthesis due to nonhepatic causes, i.e., \u201creactive hepato- pathy.\u201d \u2022 Increased ALP activity with concurrent increase in GGT activity increases specificity for hepatobiliary disease. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Multiple organ systems can influence ALP synthesis. \u2022 Increased ALP activity does not cause direct damage to other organ systems. GENETICS \u2022 Benign familial alkaline hyperphosphatasemia in Siberian huskies\u2014presumed autosomal. \u2022 Vacuolar hepatopathy of Scottish terriers\u2014breed relationship.

SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Many dogs with increased ALP activity are asymptomatic. \u2022 Dogs with hepatic or nonhepatic disorders causing increased ALP may be asymptomatic or have clinical signs related to underlying disorder. \u2022 Dogs with drug-induced elevations of ALP may have clinical signs related to drug side effects. Historical Findings \u2022 Dependent on cause. \u2022 Medication history important, including exposure to topical/ ocular medications used by humans. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Highly variable depending on cause; often normal. \u2022 Hepatomegaly or microhepatica. \u2022 Jaundice. \u2022 Abdominal pain. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014pendulous abdomen, muscle atrophy, lameness, difficulty walking, palpable bony swelling. \u2022 Dermatologic\u2014alopecia, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, comedones, thin skin, pyoderma, calcinosis cutis.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Age (young). \u2022 Breed\u2014Siberian husky, Scottish terrier. \u2022 Breed association to conditions causing alkaline hyperphosphatasemia (e.g., Shetland sheepdog predisposition to gallbladder mucocele).", "Alkalosis, Metabolic": " A process in the body that leads to an increase in pH above the reference interval. An increase in blood pH is specifically termed alkalemia. Associated with an increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration (HCO \u2013 3 ; dogs, > 24 mEq/L; cats, > 22 mEq/L) and base excess (BE; > 4 mmol/L) with a compensatory increase in carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2 ). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Metabolic alkalosis may develop from either a gain of bicarbonate or a loss of acid : \u25e6 Bicarbonate gain subsequent to: contraction alkalosis due to free water deficit; iatrogenic administration of alkalinizing therapy (e.g., NaHCO \u2013 3 ); metabolism of organic ions (lactate, citrate, acetate, and ketones); hypokalemia; and renal ammoniagenesis. \u25e6 Acid loss subsequent to: gastric or renal acid loss (loop or thiazide diuretic); mineralocorticoid excess; presence of nonreabsorbable anions; decreased weak acids (hypoalbuminemia, hypophosphatemia). \u25e6 Renal HCO \u2013 3 excretion very efficient in eliminating an excess HCO \u2013 3 load, but hindered by decreased effective circulating volume; hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyperaldosteronism; metabolic alkalosis persists only if renal excretion of HCO \u2013 3 is impaired, which primarily occurs from continued high rate of alkali administration, or some stimulus for kidneys to retain Na + in presence of a relative Cl \u2013 deficit. \u2022 Hypochloremic (corrected) metabolic alkalosis results from loss of fluid rich in Cl \u2013 and hydrogen ion (H + ), primarily from alimentary tract or kidneys; loss of Cl \u2013 and H + associated with increase in plasma HCO \u2013 3 concentration; with Cl \u2013 loss and volume depletion, kidneys reabsorb Na + with HCO \u2013 3 instead of Cl \u2013 , perpetuating metabolic alkalosis. Hypochloremic alkalosis divided into chloride-responsive and chloride-resistant : \u25e6 Chloride-responsive results primarily from loss of Cl \u2013 rich fluid and characterized by decreased extracellular fluid volume, hypo- chloremia, and low urinary Cl \u2013 concentration; this type of alkalosis responds to administration of chloride salt. \u25e6 Chlorideresistant characterized by excessive mineralocorticoid leading to increased effective circulating volume and is not responsive to chloride salt. \u2022 Hypokalemia may contribute to metabolic alkalosis by shifting H + intra- cellularly; stimulating apical H + /K + ATPase in collecting duct; stimulating renal ammoniagenesis; impairing Cl \u2013 reabsorption in distal nephron; and reducing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which decreases filtered load of HCO \u2013 3 and, in presence of volume depletion, impairs renal excretion of excess HCO \u2013 3 . \u2022 Hypoalbuminemic alkalosis is due to decrease in plasma albumin concentration; plasma albumin is a weak acid. \u2022 Compensatory metabolic alkalosis occurs in response to respiratory acidosis; this is associated with low pH and increased PCO 2 . SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous\u2014muscle twitching and seizures occur rarely in dogs. Metabolic alkalosis and associated hypokalemia may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure. \u2022 Urinary\u2014kidneys rapidly and effectively excrete excessive alkali. In patients with Cl \u2013 deficiency and volume depletion, kidneys cannot excrete excess alkali. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is maintained. In these patients, Cl \u2013 administration is required for renal compensation to occur. Volume expansion will hasten compensation. Patients with mineralocorticoid excess have excessive Cl \u2013 loss. Therefore, Cl \u2013 administration does not lead to hyperchloremia and correction of metabolic alkalosis (so-called chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis). \u2022 Respiratory\u2014low [H + ] (increased pH) decreases alveolar ventilation. Hypoventilation increases PCO 2 and helps offset the effects of high plasma HCO \u2013 3 on pH. In dogs, for each 1 mEq/L increase in plasma HCO \u2013 3 there is an expected increase of approximately 0.7 mmHg in PCO 2 . Limited data available for cats, but degree of respiratory compensation appears to be similar. SIGNALMENT Any breed, age, or sex of dog and cat.

Various substitutions of the basic phenylethylamine structure account for many pharmaceutical and illicit compounds found today. \u2022 Amphetamine is a sympathomimetic that is structurally related to norepinephrine. \u2022 Central action\u2014stimulates cortical centers including cerebral cortex, medullary respiratory center, and reticular activating systems. \u2022 Peripheral action\u2014directly stimulates alpha and beta receptors and stimulates release of norepinephrine from stores in adrenergic nerve terminals. \u2022 Amphetamine may slow catecholamine metabolism by inhibition of monoamine oxidase. \u2022 Several different product formulations, including immediate and extended release and topical patch. \u2022 Amphetamines are well absorbed orally; peak plasma levels are generally reached in 1\u20133 hours; this may be delayed with extended release formulations. \u2022 Metabolism is minimal. \u2022 The half-life, which varies from 7 to 34 hours, and rate of excretion of unchanged amphetamine in the urine are both dependent upon urine pH, with shorter half-lives associated with more acidic urine. \u2022 Clinical signs may be seen at doses below 1 mg/kg. \u2022 Oral lethal dose in dogs for most amphetamines ranges from 10 mg/kg to 23 mg/kg and for methamphetamine sulfate it is 9\u201311 mg/kg. Oral lethal dose for amphetamine sulfate is 20\u201327 mg/kg. \u2022 Amphetamine and its derivatives are used in humans to treat attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. \u2022 Illicit use of amphetamines in humans is also prevalent. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014stimulation most common: tachycardia and hypertension. \u2022 Nervous\u2014stimulation most common, depression uncommon. \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014stimulation: muscle tremors and seizures. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014stimulation, tachypnea. \u2022 Ophthalmic\u2014mydriasis. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats, although more prevalent in dogs. Breed Predilections Not applicable Mean Age and Range Not applicable Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Abnormal behavior\u2014usually hyperactivity, anxiety or pacing, anorexia, fast heart rate, panting; observed or evidence of exposure by owner/caretaker. \u2022 Onset of signs typically begins within 30 minutes to 6 hours post ingestion; depends on product formulation. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Nervous\u2014hyperactivity, agitation, restlessness, head bobbing, pacing, circling, vocalization, disorientation, hyperesthesia, ataxia, lethargy or depression (less common). \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014tachycardia or bradycardia (less common, may be reflexive), hypertension. \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014muscle fasciculation or tremors, seizures. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, excessive salivation. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea. \u2022 Ophthalmic\u2014mydriasis with possibly poor to unresponsive pupillary light response. \u2022 Other\u2014hyperthermia. CAUSES Accidental ingestion or administration, malicious poisoning. RISK FACTORS Households with children or adults currently taking prescription or illicit amphetamine or derivative.", "Amyloidosis": " Group of conditions of diverse causes in which extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins (amyloid) in various organs and tissues compromises normal function. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Patients usually affected by reactive (secondary) amyloidosis; tissue deposits contain amyloid A protein (AA), fragment of acute\u2010phase reactant protein called serum amyloid A protein (SAA). \u2022 Macrophage\u2010derived cytokines, e.g., IL\u20101 and IL\u20106, stimulate hepatocytes to synthesize SAA. \u2022 Cellular and extracellular components involved in formation and deposition of AA. \u2022 Specific pathophysiology varies among different species and breeds; reactive amyloidosis occurs as familial disease in Chinese Shar-Pei dog and Abyssinian cat. \u2022 Chinese Shar-Pei dog\u2014mutation involving overexpression of HAS2 results in overproduction of hyaluronic acid, which acts as danger signal activating inflammasome pathway and IL\u20101 production; this mutation linked to increased likelihood of developing shar\u2010pei autoinflammatory disease (SPAID), and also responsible for breed\u2019s meat\u2010mouth phenotype; amyloid deposition occurs in medulla of all dogs, with majority of dogs also having glomerular involvement. \u2022 Non\u2010sharpei dogs\u2014amyloid deposits found more commonly in glomeruli than medulla. \u2022 Abyssinian cat\u2014amyloid deposits usually found in medulla, but may occur in glomeruli. \u2022 Siamese and oriental shorthair cats with familial amyloidosis\u2014amyloid deposition occurs in liver. \u2022 Pancreatic islet amyloid polypeptide, or amylin, deposits in pancreas of old cats; amylin secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells; chronic increased stimulus for secretion of amylin by beta cells (e.g., states of insulin resistance) leads to pancreatic islet cell amyloidosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014predilection for renal AA deposition. \u2022 Liver, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, tracheobronchial tree, gastrointestinal tract also may be affected. GENETICS \u2022 Familial amyloidosis occurs in Chinese Shar-Pei, English foxhound, and beagle dogs, and in Abyssinian, oriental shorthair, and Siamese cats. \u2022 A genetic mutation that increases likelihood of SPAID in shar\u2010pei dogs has been identified; chronic inflammatory episodes in SPAID result in renal amyloid deposition. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Uncommon, occurs mostly in dogs; rare in cats, except Abyssinian, Siamese, and oriental shorthair. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Dog\u2014Chinese Shar-Pei, beagle, English foxhound, Walker hound, collies. \u2022 Cat\u2014 Abyssinian, Siamese, oriental shorthair.

Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Related to primary inflammatory or neoplastic disease process. \u2022 Animals with renal disease may have muscle wasting, abnormal renal palpation, uremic ulceration, hypertensive fundic lesions. \u2022 Fluid retention may be present (ascites, peripheral edema). \u2022 Chinese Shar-Pei dogs may have evidence of SPAID if present during active flare\u2010up (joint effusion and pain, fever). \u2022 Signs of thromboembolic disease may be present in up to 40% of dogs with renal amyloidosis (dyspnea with pulmonary embolism, caudal paresis with aortic embolism). \u2022 Siamese and oriental shorthair cats with hepatic dysfunction may have jaundice; pallor and abdominal fluid wave may be present with hepatic fracture and hemoabdomen. CAUSES \u2022 Neoplasia and chronic infectious and noninfectious inflammatory conditions can be found in 30\u201350% of dogs with reactive amyloidosis. \u2022 Chronic inflammation\u2014 systemic mycoses, chronic bacterial infections, parasitic infections (dirofilariasis, leishmaniasis, hepatozoonosis), inflammatory and immune\u2010mediated diseases (SPAID, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile polyarteritis of beagle); amyloid deposits can be found in up to 35% of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)\u2010positive cats. \u2022 Neoplasia (lymphoma, plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, mammary tumors, testicular tumors). \u2022 Familial\u2014 Chinese Shar-Pei, English foxhound, and beagle dogs; Abyssinian, Siamese, and oriental shorthair cats. \u2022 Other\u2014cyclic hematopoiesis in gray collies.", "Anaerobic Infections": " \u2022 Anaerobic bacteria require low oxygen tension to live, and constitute a large portion of the normal flora. \u2022 May be Gram-positive or Gram-negative cocci or rods, and individual organisms vary in potential to withstand oxygen exposure. \u2022 Most common genera\u2014 Bacteroides , Fusobacterium , Actinomyces , Propionibacterium , Peptostreptococcus (enteric Streptococcus ), Porphyromonas , and Clostridium . \u2022 Most anaerobic infections are polymicrobial and can contain anaerobes admixed with facultative anaerobes or aerobic bacteria (especially E. coli ). \u2022 Injurious toxins and enzymes elaborated by the organisms may allow extension of infection into adjacent, healthy tissue. SIGNALMENT Dog and cat. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Depend on body system involved. \u2022 Areas associated with mucous membranes are more commonly associated with anaerobic infection. \u2022 It is possible to overlook anaerobes in an infectious process, leading to confusion in interpreting culture results and selection of antimicrobials.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 First exposure of the patient to a particular antigen (allergen) causes a humoral response and results in production of IgE, which binds to the surface of mast cells. The patient is then considered to be sensitized to that antigen. \u2022 Second exposure to the antigen results in cross\u00adlinking of two or more IgE molecules on the cell surface, resulting in mast cell degranulation and activation. Release of mast cell granules initiates an anaphylactic reaction. \u2022 Major mast cell\u2013derived mediators include histamine, eosinophilic chemotactic factor, arachidonic acid and metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes), platelet\u00adactivating factor, and proteases. Release of these mediators causes an inflammatory response characterized by increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory cell influx, and tissue damage. \u2022 Clinical manifestations depend on the route of antigen exposure, the dose of antigen, and the level and specificity of the IgE response. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014salivation, vomiting, and diarrhea. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, shock. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014dyspnea, cyanosis/hypoxemia. \u2022 Skin/exocrine\u2014pruritus, urticaria, and edema. \u2022 Hepatobiliary (dogs)\u2014portal hypertension, vasoconstriction, ascites.

There is decreased production of granulocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets, resulting in pancytopenia in the peripheral blood. The disease is sometimes also referred to as aplastic pancytopenia. \u2022 In the acute form, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia predominate because of the shorter life spans of these cells; in the chronic form, nonregenerative anemia also occurs. In both forms, the bone marrow exhibits variable degrees of panhypoplasia. \u2022 Precipitating causes can include infectious diseases, drug or toxin exposure, and starvation; immunemediated mechanisms are often suspected. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune systems affected.

Nonregenerative Anemia with Other Cytopenias \u2022 Toxicities\u2014drugs or chemicals, hormones (e.g., estrogen). \u2022 Infections\u2014feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Cytauxzoon felis , parvovirus (occasionally just erythroid line affected). \u2022 Infiltrative processes\u2014myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases, histiocytic sarcoma, metastatic neoplasia, myelofibrosis, osteosclerosis. RISK FACTORS \u2022 CKD. \u2022 Inflammatory or chronic disease. \u2022 Multicat household/cattery (infectious disease risk). \u2022 Daily exposure to toxins (e.g., old homes with lead paint, environmental pollution).", "Anemia, Nuclear Maturation Defects (Anemia, Megaloblastic)": " \u2022 Nonregenerative anemia characterized by impaired DNA synthesis in red blood cell (RBC) precursors (nuclear : cytoplasmic asynchrony). \u2022 Affected RBC precursors fail to divide normally and thus are larger than corresponding normal precursors; their nuclei are deficient in chromatin with open and stippled appearance; these giant precursors with atypical nuclei are known as megaloblasts. Hemoglobin content in these precursors is normal. \u2022 Asynchronous changes most prominent in RBC precursors, but white blood cell (WBC) and platelet precursors similarly affected. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Cats\u2014often associated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. \u2022 Dogs\u2014usually acquired, but may be inherited. \u2022 Breed predilection for inherited cobalamin malabsorption\u2014giant schnauzers, Australian shepherds, Komondorok, and beagles\u2014 present as young as 8\u201312 weeks; border collies as young adults. \u2022 Familial macrocytosis and megaloblastic change in toy/miniature poodles. SIGNS \u2022 In dogs, anemia often not symptomatic. For cobalamin deficiency, clinical signs include gastrointestinal signs and failure to thrive. Affected poodles usually not anemic. \u2022 In cats, anemia may be mild to marked, if FeLV positive. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Infectious\u2014FeLV most common cause in cats. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infrequently reported as causative agent. \u2022 Nutritional\u2014folic acid and cobalamin deficiencies, primarily in dogs with inherited cobalamin malabsorption (uncommon with other causes of cobalamin deficiency). \u2022 Toxic\u2014many drugs such as immunomodulators, chemotherapeutic agents, anticonvulsants, antibiotics. \u2022 Congenital\u2014toy/miniature poodles.", "Anemia, Regenerative": " Decreased circulating red blood cell (RBC) mass (indicated by low packed cell volume [PCV] or hematocrit [HCT], hemoglobin, and total RBC count) accompanied by appropriate, compensatory increase in RBC production by the bone marrow. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Caused by blood loss or hemolysis. \u2022 Hemolysis\u2014caused by intrinsic RBC defects (e.g., congenital RBC membrane defects or enzyme deficiencies) or extrinsic factors (e.g., RBC parasites, oxidative injury, hemolysins, osmotic changes, immunemediated RBC destruction, hemophagocytic neoplasia, heat stroke, and severe hypophos- phatemia).

CAUSES Neurologic See Table 1. Ocular See Table 2. RISK FACTORS Not applicable", "Anorexia": " Anorexia is the lack or loss of appetite for food. Hyporexia is a reduction in appetite, while dysrexia is a change in appetite or lack of consistent appetite. Anorexia results in decreased food intake, which then leads to weight loss, dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, and/or sarcopenia. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The control of appetite is a complex interaction between the central nervous system, the environment, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. \u2022 The hypothalamus and brainstem contain feeding\u2010regulatory neurons that act as input stations for sensory and metabolic signals. These cell populations project to several brain regions and interconnect extensively. \u2022 Sensory signals that affect appetite include the odor, taste, texture, and temperature of food, as well as gastric and duodenal distention. \u2022 Metabolic signals for hunger and satiety include a variety of peptides and hormones released during the fasting and fed states, as well as plasma concentrations of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. \u2022 Insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and pancreatic peptide decrease hunger centrally. \u2022 Leptin, produced primarily by adipocytes, acts on specific hypothalamic receptors to increase metabolism and decrease appetite. \u2022 Neuropeptide Y, released from the GI tract after food restriction, induces hunger and decreases energy expenditure. \u2022 Ghrelin, produced by the stomach, is a prokinetic and increases appetite; it decreases leptin and increases neuropeptide Y production. \u2022 Serotonin is an important central mediator and acts via a serotonergic tract that passes near the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei (satiety center). \u2022 Dopaminergic tracts in the hypo- thalamus help regulate food intake and are closely associated with the lateral hypothalamic nuclei (feeding center). \u2022 Environmental factors including the location and timing of meals, as well as learned behaviors and circadian rhythms, modulate appetite. \u2022 Brain lesions that affect the hypothalamus can decrease or increase appetite; any disorder that decreases cerebral arousal will potentially decrease food intake. \u2022 Inflammatory and neoplastic diseases can cause hyporexia by the release of proinflamm - atory cytokines. \u2022 The expected upregulation of dietary intake in response to increased energy expenditure is frequently absent in patients with neoplastic and advanced cardiac diseases. \u2022 Exogenous and endogenous toxins (e.g., renal and liver failure) cause hyporexia. \u2022 Neoplasia, metabolic disorders, pancreatitis, and primary GI diseases are associated with hyporexia. \u2022 Fear, pain, and stress may decrease appetite.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Antebrachium\u2014predisposed to deformities resulting from growth of one bone after premature growth cessation or growth retardation of the paired bone. \u2022 Decreased rate of elongation in one bone behaves as a retarding strap; the growing paired bone must twist and curve around the short bone or overgrow at the elbow or carpus; causes joint malalignment. \u2022 Normal growth\u2014bones elongate through the process of endochondral ossification, which occurs in the physis; physis closure occurs when the germinal cell layer stops producing new cartilage and the existing cartilage hypertrophies, ossifies, and is remodeled into bone. \u2022 Hereditary\u2014may be a component of common elbow joint malalignment in many chondrodysplastic breeds (e.g., basset hound and Lhasa apso). \u2022 Osteochondrosis (OC) or dietary oversupplementation\u2014possibly associated with retardation of endochondral ossification (retained cartilaginous cores) in giant-breed dogs. \u2022 Hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD)\u2014 juvenile growth syndrome with physeal and periosteal inflammation that may impede growth. \u2022 Trauma\u2014most common cause; if germinal cell layer of the physis is damaged, new cartilage production and bone elongation are stopped. Commonly occurs with injury (fractures or crushing injuries) involving the distal ulnar or radial growth plates. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Musculoskeletal GENETICS \u2022 Skye terriers\u2014reported as a recessive inheritable trait. \u2022 Chondrodysplastic breeds (dogs)\u2014 disturbed endochondral ossification results in asynchronous growth of the paired bone system, resulting in altered growth, angular deformity, and possible elbow malalignment. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Traumatic\u2014may occur in up to 10% of actively growing dogs that sustain injuries of the antebrachium; uncommon in cats. \u2022 Elbow malalignment syndrome \u00b1 angular deformity (chondrodysplastic dog breeds)\u2014 fairly common and can be bilateral; clinical abnormality in affected individuals is variable. \u2022 Nutritionally induced\u2014incidence decreasing as nutritional standards are improved. \u2022 Congenital agenesis of the radius (cats and rarely dogs)\u2014occurs infrequently; results in severely bowed antebrachium and carpal subluxation.

SNRIs include desvenlafaxine (Pristiq\u00ae), duloxetine (Cymbalta\u00ae), levomilnacipran (Fetzima\u00ae), milnacipran (Ixel\u00ae, Savella\u00ae), tofenacin (Elamol\u00ae, Tofacine\u00ae), and venlafaxine (Effexor\u00ae). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 SSRIs and SNRIs are antidepressants that inhibit reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in aggression, anxiety, appetite, depression, migraine, pain, and sleep. Antidepressant effects are secondary to inhibition of reuptake of serotonin into serotonergic neurons via binding to the serotonin transporter, resulting in increased synaptic availability of serotonin. SNRIs also inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine by the same mechanism. \u2022 Excessive stimulation of serotonin receptors can occur by enhanced serotonin synthesis, increased presynaptic serotonin release, inhibition of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic neuron, inhibition of serotonin metabolism, or serotonin agonism. Ingesting too much of one medication or a combination of medications that increase serotonin via different methods can lead to serotonin syndrome. \u2022 Serotonin syndrome is characterized in humans as a combination of symptoms that include at least three of the following: myoclonus, mental aberration, agitation, hyperreflexia, tremors, diarrhea, ataxia, or hyperthermia. \u2022 Toxic dosage varies widely among commonly available SSRIs and SNRIs and is not well defined in veterinary medicine.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Animals on a serotonergic drug. \u2022 Underlying liver or kidney disease; cats are attracted to venlafaxine and will eat multiple capsules.", "Antidepressant Toxicosis\u2014Tricyclic": " \u2022 Toxicity secondary to the acute or chronic ingestion of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). \u2022 TCA medications include amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, maprotiline (tetracyclic antidepressant), nortriptyline, protriptyline, trimipramine, and many others. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 TCAs block the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin at the neuronal membrane. They also have anticholinergic activity and are thought to have membrane\u00adstabilizing effects on the myocardium (particularly inhibiting fast sodium channels in the ventricular myocardium). They can also have slight alpha\u00adadrenergic blocking activity and antihistaminic effects. \u2022 TCAs are rapidly and well absorbed across the digestive tract. They can decrease GI motility and delay gastric emptying, resulting in delayed drug absorption. \u2022 Lipophilic, protein bound, and well distributed across all tissues. \u2022 They are metabolized by the liver and undergo enterohepatic recirculation. The inactive metabolites are eliminated in the urine. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous\u2014increased dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels in the CNS contribute to CNS signs. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014anticholinergic effects and inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake contribute to tachycardia; alpha adrenergic blockade, cardiac membrane stabilization, and decreased cardiac contractility contribute to hypotension and arrhythmias. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014anticholinergic effects may cause ileus and delayed gastric emptying. \u2022 Ophthalmic\u2014anticholinergic effects can cause pupillary dilation. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014anticholinergic effects may cause urinary retention. GENETICS Species and individual differences in absorption, metabolism, and elimination can be significant. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Incidence is unknown. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Concurrent use of other antipsychotic medication. \u2022 Preexisting cardiac disease.", "Aortic Stenosis": " \u2022 A narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) that restricts blood flow leaving the ventricle; most commonly congenital, often heritable. \u2022 Lesion is most commonly subvalvular in dogs, but may be valvular or supravalvular (more often in cats). \u2022 Subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) in dogs is caused by fibrous tissue manifested as nodules, a ridge, a ring, or a tunnel\u2010like lesion. SAS may be associated with other defects, including mitral valve dysplasia. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Restriction to outflow generates pressure overload of left ventricle (LV). \u2022 Degree of obstruction is related to severity of secondary changes. \u2022 LV pressure overload causes thickened LV walls, resulting in diminished blood supply relative to muscle demand and myocardial ischemia; this may result in arrhythmogenesis and, if severe or infarction occurs, mechanical dysfunction. \u2022 Restriction to blood flow causes high\u2010velocity, turbulent flow across valve, which may cause endothelial damage, lead to aortic insufficiency (AI), and predispose to endocarditis. \u2022 SAS may lead to chamber enlargement, distortion of the mitral valve annulus, and mitral regurgitation, with possible sequela of left\u2010sided congestive heart failure (CHF). \u2022 Sudden death is common with severe SAS and may be secondary to arrhythmias or infarction. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014LV pressure overload leading to arrhythmias, syncope, sudden death, heart failure, endocarditis. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014 possible pulmonary edema with CHF. \u2022 Multisystemic\u2014possible due to low cardiac output or endocarditis. GENETICS \u2022 SAS inherited in the Newfoundland, golden retriever, Rottweiler, bullmastiff, and dogue de Bordeaux. \u2022 Mutation in phosphatidy- linositol\u2010binding clathrin assembly protein gene (PICALM) reported in Newfoundlands; screening test is available. \u2022 Dominant inheritance patterns proposed for Newfoundlands with incomplete penetrance responsible for disease appearing to skip generations. \u2022 More than one gene or modifying genes may be involved. \u2022 Golden retrievers, Rottweilers, and bullmastiffs appear to inherit SAS in autosomal recessive pattern, but no associated mutation yet identified. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 SAS is one of most common congenital heart defects of dogs; it is reported as second most common, but difficulty in diagnosing mild disease may underestimate true prevalence. \u2022 Aortic stenosis reported as small contributor of feline congenital heart disease, about 6%; approximately 2 out of 1,000 dogs and 0.2 per 1,000 cats evaluated at veterinary teaching hospitals are diagnosed with aortic stenosis, SAS most often in dogs and supravalvular aortic stenosis most often in cats. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Newfoundland, bullmastiff, golden retriever, Rottweiler, bouvier des Flandres, dogue de Bordeaux, German shepherd, and boxer have highest incidence of SAS and familial component or heritability is reported. \u2022 No breed predilection reported for cats. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Clinical signs may be seen at any age. \u2022 Although often inherited, SAS becomes identifiable during first few weeks to months of life as subvalvular lesion progresses. \u2022 Full phenotype is appreciated by 1 year of age. Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Many dogs show no clinical signs and have no relevant historical findings. \u2022 Historical findings related to disease severity and may include syncope, exercise intolerance, sudden death, and signs due to CHF such as respira- tory distress and/or coughing if severe. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Systolic left basilar ejection murmur; may radiate to apex, right side of thorax, include carotid arteries, and if very loud the cranium; precordial thrill may be palpable; murmur intensity loosely correlated to severity; as disease worsens during early life, some may have absence of or quiet murmur that develops to more characteristic finding by 1 year. \u2022 Diastolic murmur may be present with significant AI; combination of this diastolic murmur with systolic ejection murmur is to\u2010and\u2010fro murmur. \u2022 Arrhythmias may be ausculted. \u2022 Pulse deficits may be appreciated, often associated with ventricular arrhythmias. \u2022 Weak pulses may be appreciated that are late or slow to rise with severe SAS (pulsus parvus et tardus). \u2022 Tachypnea, respiratory distress, and crackles may occur with CHF. General Comments \u2022 Boxers have relatively small aorta compared to other breeds, which can be difficult to distinguish from mild SAS. \u2022 Bull terriers overrepresented for combined mitral valve dysplasia and SAS. \u2022 Newfoundland dogs overrepresented for combined patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and SAS. \u2022 Volume overload of PDA can cause relative aortic stenosis and be difficult to distinguish from PDA with mild SAS. CAUSES \u2022 Congenital heart disease. \u2022 Secondary to valvular change, as with aortic valve endocarditis or calcification. \u2022 Component of complex congenital heart disease, as with some cases of mitral valve dysplasia. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Familial history of SAS. \u2022 SAS predisposes to aortic valve endocarditis. \u2022 Aortic valve endocarditis predisposes to valvar aortic stenosis.", "Aortic Thromboembolism": " A thrombus or blood clot that is dislodged within the aorta, causing severe ischemia to the tissues served by that segment of aorta. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Aortic thromboembolism (ATE) is commonly associated with myocardial disease in cats, most commonly hypertrophic cardio - myopathy (HCM). It is theorized that abnormal blood flow (stasis) and a hypercoagulable state contribute to thrombus formation within the left atrium. The thrombus then embolizes distally to the aorta. The most common site of embolization is the caudal aortic trifurcation (hind legs). Other less common sites include the front legs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, or cerebrum. \u2022 ATE in dogs typically is associated with neoplasia, sepsis, infectious endocarditis, Cushing\u2019s disease, protein-losing nephropathy and enteropathy, or other hypercoagulable states. However, in one recent retrospective study, no concurrent condition was identified in 58% of dogs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014most affected cats have advanced heart disease and left heart failure. \u2022 Nervous/musculoskeletal\u2014severe ischemia to muscles and nerves served by segment of occluded aorta causes variable pain and paresis. Gait abnormality or paralysis results in leg or legs involved. GENETICS HCM, a common associated disease, is likely heritable. Additionally, a family of domestic shorthair cats with remodeled HCM who all died of ATE has been reported. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 In a recent observation study of over 1000 asymptomatic cats with HCM, nearly 12% developed ATE within 10 years after initial diagnosis. In two previous smaller case series of cats with clinical and preclinical HCM, 12\u201316% presented with signs of ATE; only 11\u201325% of cats had evidence of previously known heart disease. \u2022 Rare in dogs. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Cat, rarely dog. Breed Predilections Mixed-breed cats most commonly affected. Abyssians, Birmans, and ragdolls overrepresented in one study. In dogs, no breed predilection identified in United States; European study suggested cavalier King Charles spaniels may be overrepresented. Mean Age and Range Age range\u20141\u201320 years. Median age\u2014 approximately 8\u20139 years (cats); 8\u201310 years (dogs). Predominant Sex Cats\u2014males > females (2 : 1). Dogs\u2014no sex predilection in United States; European study suggested male predilection. SIGNS Presence of 5 \u201cPs\u201d is helpful to remember classic clinical signs associated with ATE\u2014 Pain, Paralysis or Paresis, Pulselessness, Pallor, and Poikilothermic (cold). Historical Findings \u2022 Acute onset paralysis and pain\u2014most common in cats. Vocalization and anxiety also common. \u2022 Lameness or gait abnormality, typically of several weeks\u2019 duration, more common in dogs. \u2022 Tachypnea or respiratory distress common in cats. \u2022 About 15% of cats may vomit prior to ATE. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Usually paraparesis or paralysis of rear legs with signs of lower motor neuron injury. Less commonly, monoparesis of a front leg. In dogs, majority are paretic and ambulatory. \u2022 Absent or diminished femoral pulses. \u2022 Pain upon palpation of legs. \u2022 Gastrocnemius muscle often becomes firm several hours after embolization. \u2022 Cyanotic or pale nail beds and foot pads. \u2022 Tachypnea/dyspnea and hypothermia are common in cats. \u2022 Since commonly associated with heart disease in cats, cardiac murmur, arrhythmias, or gallop sound may be present. CAUSES \u2022 Cardiomyopathy (all types). \u2022 Hyperthyroidism. \u2022 Neoplasia. \u2022 Sepsis (dogs). \u2022 Hyperadrenocorticism (dogs). \u2022 Protein-losing nephropathy and enteropathy (dogs). RISK FACTORS \u2022 In cats, cardiomyopathy, male sex, and gallop sound on exam are risk factors. Echocardiographic risk factors include enlarged left atrium, decreased left atrial function and left atrial appendage velocity, presence of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (smoke) or left atrial thrombus, and restrictive left ventricular filling pattern. \u2022 In dogs, hypercoagulable conditions, such as neoplasia, sepsis, endocarditis, proteinlosing nephropathies/enteropathies, and hyperadrenocorticism are risk factors.", "Apudoma": " \u2022 Tumors of endocrine cells that are capable of amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) and secretion of peptide hormones. \u2022 APUD cells are generally found in gastrointestinal tract and CNS. \u2022 Hypergastrinemia from gastrinsecreting tumors (gastrinomas) causes gastritis and duodenal hyperacidity, which can cause gastric ulceration, gastric mucosal hypertrophy, esophageal dysfunction (chronic reflux), and intestinal villous atrophy. \u2022 Polypeptide-secreting tumors (polypeptidomas) may not cause clinical signs, but high concentration of pancreatic polypeptide may cause gastric hyperacidity and gastrointestinal ulceration. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Gastrinoma\u2014rare in dogs, very rare in cats; age range 3\u201312 years, mean 7.5 years (dogs). \u2022 Pancreatic polypeptidoma\u2014extremely rare in dogs.

SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat (rare in both). \u2022 No specific age, breed, or sex\u2014AVMs typically in younger animals; 15% of hepatic AVMs found in Labrador retrievers in a recent multicenter study. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Depends on the lesion location (e.g., ascites with hepatic AVM). \u2022 Often prior trauma to affected area with AVF. \u2022 Warm, nonpainful swelling at site may be noted. \u2022 Shunt may cause local organ dysfunction. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Vary and depend on location. \u2022 Signs of CHF (e.g., tachypnea, cough, exercise intolerance) may develop with chronic disease and high blood flow. \u2022 Bounding pulses may be present due to high ejection volume and rapid runoff through AVM/AVF. \u2022 Continuous murmur (bruit) at the site. \u2022 Cautious compression of the artery proximal to the lesion abolishes the bruit. When blood flow is high, this may also elicit an immediate reflex decrease in heart rate (Branham\u2019s sign). \u2022 Edema, ischemia, and congestion of organs and tissues caused by high venous pressure in proximity of lesion. \u2022 If the lesion is on a limb, pitting edema, lameness, ulceration, scabbing, and gangrene may result. \u2022 Lesions near vital organs may cause signs associated with organ failure, e.g., ascites (liver), seizures (brain), paresis (spinal cord). CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 AVM is rare; frequently congenital. \u2022 Acquired AVF typically results from local vascular damage via trauma, surgery, veni - puncture, perivascular injection, or neoplasia.", "Arteriovenous Malformation of the Liver": " \u2022 Intrahepatic arteriovenous (AV) malformations (also referred to as AV fistulae) are communications between proper hepatic arteries and intrahepatic portal veins; this anatomic union results in hepatofugal (away from the liver) splanchnic circulation. \u2022 Blood flows directly from a hepatic artery into portal vasculature retrograde into the vena cava through multiple acquired porto \u00ad systemic shunts (APSS). \u2022 Associated with ascites. \u2022 Uncommon, usually congenital, but may be acquired (surgical injury, trauma, neoplasia).

OA is characterized as a noninfectious disorder of diarthrodial (synovial) joints, such that the disease process involves the entire joint, not just the articular cartilage. It is due to both primary (idiopathic) and secondary causes. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Ebb and flow characterization with periods of calmness followed by periods of exacerbation of clinical signs (flare-ups). \u2022 OA initiated by mechanical stress\u2014 traumatic injury, instability, abnormal conformation, abnormal activity, etc. \u2022 Inflammatory mediators and free radicals such as metalloproteinases, serine proteases, cysteine protease enzymes, and reactive oxygen species are released from damaged chondrocytes and synovium, resulting in breakdown of extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, causing collagen degradation and loss of collagen cross-linking. \u2022 Collagen synthesis is altered, resulting in decreased collagen/proteoglycan interaction and reduced hydrophilic matrix properties. \u2022 Extracellular matrix further compromised by increased breakdown of proteoglycans along with manufacture of poorer-quality proteoglycans. \u2022 Nitric oxide released along with other free radicals, which mediates cartilage breakdown and supports chronic inflammation. Chondrocyte apoptosis facilitated by cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes and oxidative stress. \u2022 Synovitis is driving force of the inflammatory cascade in OA, in addition to resulting in decreased viscosity of synovial fluid, reducing lubrication. \u2022 Poorer-quality synovial fluid reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to chondrocytes as well as waste removal. \u2022 Subchondral bone becomes sclerotic, worsening loading qualities of bone and overlying cartilage. \u2022 Pain of OA results from distention of the joint capsule and stimulation of pain receptors, inflammation of synovium, increased mechanical loading of subchondral bone, alteration of function of surrounding tendons and ligaments, as well as development of periarticular fibrosis. \u2022 The result of these processes is progressive cartilage degradation ranging from fibrillation to deep fissuring of cartilage. Full-thickness cartilage loss can eventually occur. \u2022 Periarticular fibrosis occurs, resulting in a reduction of joint motion (and pain), leading to poorer vascularity of synovial membrane as well as lack of functionality of synovium due to lack of motion in joint. \u2022 Osteophytes and enthesiophytes develop around and within joint to increase loadbearing surface area. \u2022 These changes reduce functionality and may eventually lead to ankylosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Musculoskeletal\u2014diarthrodial joints. GENETICS \u2022 Primary OA rare, occurring more commonly in cats or in smaller (manus, pes) joints of dogs. \u2022 Dogs\u2014causes of secondary OA are varied, including hip and elbow dysplasia, osteochondritis dessicans (OCD), patellar luxations, congenital shoulder luxation, Legg-Perthes, cranial cruciate ligament rupture, intra-articular fractures, obesity, as well as many other causes. \u2022 Cats\u2014causes of secondary OA are patellar luxation, hip dysplasia, obesity, and arthro - pathy. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Dog\u2014very common; 20% of dogs older than 1 year have some degree of OA. \u2022 Cat\u201490% of cats over 12 years of age had evidence of OA on radiographs. \u2022 Clinical problems are more prevalent in larger, overweight, and very active animals. \u2022 Primary OA is rare.

No physical examination findings or biomarkers can distinguish between the two syndromes, although reversal of airflow obstruction following administration of a beta\u2010agonist is suggestive of the asthmatic form of disease.

All cause limb incoordination, but only vestibular and cerebellar ataxia cause head and neck incoordination. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Sensory (Proprioceptive) \u2022 Proprioceptive pathways in the spinal cord (i.e., fasciculus gracilis, fasciculus cuneatus, and spinocerebellar tracts) relay limb and trunk positions to the brain. \u2022 When the spinal cord is slowly compressed, proprioceptive deficits are usually the first signs observed, because these tracts or pathways are located more superficially in the white matter and their larger axons are more susceptible to compression than are other tracts. \u2022 Limb weakness (paresis) will occur if more centrally located motor tracts or pathways become involved; weakness is not always obvious early in the course of the disease. \u2022 Ataxia can occur with spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral lesions. Ataxia can be mild to absent with unilateral brainstem lesions, and subtle to absent with unilateral cerebral lesions. Vestibular \u2022 Changes in balance and head and neck positions are detected by vestibular receptors of the inner ear, relayed to the vestibulocochlear nerve, which is connected to vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. \u2022 The inner ear\u2019s vestibular receptors and nerve are components of the peripheral nervous system, whereas brainstem vestibular nuclei are components of the central nervous system. \u2022 Vestibular ataxia should be localized to either the peripheral or central vestibular nervous system, because prognosis and rule\u00adouts differ for these two locations. \u2022 Both locations of vestibular disease cause various degrees of vestibular ataxia, often manifested by head tilt and leaning, falling, or even rolling toward the side of the lesion. \u2022 Central vestibular disease usually has vertical nystagmus or changing types of nystagmus; somnolence, stupor, or coma (due to involvement of the nearby ascending reticular activating system); multiple cranial nerve signs (e.g., trigeminal or facial nerve deficits); proprioceptive deficits and quadriparesis or hemiparesis. \u2022 Peripheral vestibular disease does not typically show changes in mental status, vertical nystagmus, proprioceptive deficits, quadriparesis, or hemiparesis. \u2022 Bilateral vestibular disease is uncommon and most often peripheral in origin. Typical vestibular signs are absent. Wide swinging back and forth head motions and poor to absent physiologic nystagmus are characteristic. Cerebellar \u2022 The cerebellum regulates, coordinates, and modulates motor activity. \u2022 Proprioception is normal because the ascending proprioceptive pathways to the cortex are intact; weakness does not occur because the upper motor neurons are intact. \u2022 While strength is preserved, affected animals have uncoordinated motor activity of limbs, head, and neck manifested by hyper \u00ad metria; dysmetria; head tremors; intention tremors; and truncal sway.

Two forms recognized: primary atrial fibrillation, an uncommon disease that occurs mostly in large dogs with no under - lying cardiac disease; and secondary atrial fibrillation, which occurs in dogs and cats secondary to underlying cardiac disease. \u2022 Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the atrial rate is generally slower and is characterized by saw-toothed flutter waves in the baseline of the ECG. The ventricular response is generally rapid, but may be regular or irregular. ECG Features Atrial Flutter \u2022 Atrial rhythm usually regular; rate approx - imately 300\u2013400 bpm. \u2022 P waves usually discerned as either discrete P waves or \u201csaw- toothed\u201d baseline. \u2022 Ventricular rhythm and rate generally depend on atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction, but are generally regular or regularly irregular and rapid. \u2022 Conduction pattern to ventricles is variable\u2014in some cases every other atrial depolarization produces a ventricular depolarization (2 : 1 conduction ratio), giving a regular ventricular rhythm (Figure 1); other times the conduction pattern appears random, giving an irregular ventricular rhythm that can mimic atrial fibrillation. Secondary Atrial Fibrillation \u2022 No P waves present\u2014baseline may be flat or may have small irregular undulations (\u201cf\u201d waves); some undulations may look like P waves. \u2022 Ventricular rate often elevated\u2014 usually 180\u2013240 bpm in dogs and > 220 bpm in cats. \u2022 Interval between QRS complexes is irregularly irregular; QRS complexes usually appear normal (Figure  2). Primary Atrial Fibrillation Similar to secondary atrial fibrillation, except ventricular rate usually in normal range. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Atrial fibrillation\u2014caused by numerous small reentrant pathways creating a rapid ( > 500 depolarizations/minute) and disorganized depolarization pattern in the atria that results in cessation of atrial contraction. Depolarizations continuously bombard the AV nodal tissue, which acts as a filter and does not allow all depolarizations to conduct to the ventricles. Many atrial depolarizations activate only a part of the atria, because the rapid rate renders portions of the atria refractory, and thus they cannot reach the AV junction. Other atrial impulses penetrate into the AV junctional tissue, but do not penetrate the entire length. Blocked impulses affect the conduction properties of the AV junctional tissue and alter conduction of subsequent electrical impulses; electrical impulses are conducted through the AV junction irregularly, producing an irregular ventricular rhythm. \u2022 Atrial flutter\u2014probably originates from one site of reentry that moves continuously throughout the atrial myocardium and frequently and regularly stimulates the AV node. When the atrial rate becomes sufficiently fast, the refractory period of the AV node exceeds the cycle length (P to P interval) of the supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and some atrial depolarizations are blocked from traversing the AV node (functional seconddegree AV block). SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cardiovascular Loss of atrial contraction may result in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output, depending on heart rate; high heart rate may result in deterioration in myocardial function (tachycardia-induced myocardial failure). GENETICS No breeding studies available. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Large- and giant-breed dogs more prone to primary atrial fibrillation. Mean Age and Range Not applicable Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Generally relate to underlying disease process and/or congestive heart failure (CHF) rather than arrhythmia itself, but previously stable animals may decompensate. \u2022 Patients with primary atrial fibrillation are generally asymptomatic, but may demonstrate mild exercise intolerance. Historical Findings \u2022 Coughing/dyspnea/tachypnea. \u2022 Exercise intolerance. \u2022 Rarely, syncope. \u2022 Dogs with primary atrial fibrillation are typically asymptomatic. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 On auscultation, patients with atrial fibrillation have an erratic heart rhythm that sounds like \u201ctennis shoes in a dryer.\u201d \u2022 First heart sound intensity in atrial fibrillation is variable; second heart sound only heard on beats with effective ejection, not on every beat. \u2022 Third heart sounds (gallop sounds) may be present. \u2022 Patients with atrial fibrillation have pulse deficits and variable pulse quality. \u2022 Signs of CHF often present (e.g., cough, dyspnea, cyanosis).

ECG Features \u2022 Heart rate usually normal; rhythm irregular due to the premature P wave (called a P \u2032 wave) that disrupts the normal P wave rhythm (Figure 1). \u2022 Ectopic P \u2032 wave\u2014 premature; configuration differs from that of the sinus P waves and may be negative, positive, biphasic, or superimposed on the previous T wave. \u2022 QRS complex\u2014 premature; configuration usually normal (same as that of the sinus complexes). If the P \u2032 wave occurs during the refractory period of the atrioventricular (AV) node, ventricular conduction does not occur (nonconducted APCs), so no QRS complex follows the P \u2032 wave. If there is partial recovery in the AV node or intraventricular conduction systems, the P \u2032 wave is conducted with a long P \u2032 \u2013R interval or with an abnormal QRS configuration (aberrant conduction). The more premature the complex, the more marked the aberration. \u2022 In the P\u2013QRS relationship, the P \u2032 \u2013R interval is usually as long as, or longer than, the sinus P \u2032 \u2013R interval. \u2022 A noncompensatory pause\u2014when the R\u2013R interval of the two normal sinus complexes enclosing an APC is less than the R\u2013R intervals of three consecutive sinus complexes\u2014usually follows an APC (Figure 2).

Acquired atrial septal defects (ASD) secondary to atrial rupture reported with canine degenerative mitral valve disease. \u2022 Comprises 0.7\u20133.7% of congenital heart defects in dogs, < 10% of congenital heart defects in cats. Significantly higher incidence (37.7%) noted in one study. \u2022 Three major types of ASD classified based on the location of the defect within the interatrial septum\u2014 ostium primum ASD (most apical portion of septum, adjacent to the atrioventricular [AV] valves), ostium secundum ASD (central portion of the septum, region of fossa ovalis), and sinus venosus ASD (adjacent to cranial or caudal vena cava). \u2022 Secundum ASD with left-to-right shunting is most common (98.7% in one study of dogs and cats). \u2022 Ostium primum ASD typically large; possible component of AV canal defect. \u2022 Sinus venosus ASD typically located at junction of cranial vena cava (less commonly caudal vena cava) and right atrium. Right pulmonary veins may be directed at right atrium through the defect. May be associated with anomalous pulmonary venous connections of some/all pulmonary veins. \u2022 Isolated ASD typically shunts left to right. Magnitude of flow dependent on ASD size, relative systemic and pulmonary resistance, and relative ventricular compliance. Small restrictive defects allow atria to maintain normal differential pressure. Large defects may have significant left-to-right shunting, causing volume overload to right heart and pulmonary vessels. Secondary pulmonary hypertension can reverse shunting (i.e., right to left), termed Eisenmenger\u2019s physiology.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Endocardial splitting typically results from increased LA pressure secondary to severe mitral regurgitation and mechanical trauma from the regurgitant jet; primary endocardial degeneration may also play a role. \u2022 If split is incomplete, fibrin may seal the defect temporarily; either heals as a linear depression in endocardial surface or subsequently extends through myocardium, resulting in complete tear. \u2022 LA tear results in peracute bleeding into pericardial sac and acute cardiac tamponade. \u2022 If tear occurs in interatrial septum, an acquired atrial septal defect may form. \u2022 Tearing of either atrium may also rarely occur secondary to blunt trauma, or iatrogenically during pericardiocentesis or cardiac catheterization.

RISK FACTORS Any condition or intervention that enhances vagal tone.", "Atrioventricular Valve Dysplasia": " A congenital malformation of the mitral or tricuspid valve apparatus. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Atrioventricular valve dysplasia (AVVD) can result in valvular insufficiency, valvular stenosis, or dynamic outflow tract obstruction, depending on the anatomic abnormality. AVVD may occur alone or in association with abnormalities of the ipsilateral outflow tract (e.g., valvular or subvalvular aortic or pulmonic stenosis). It is not uncommon for mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia to occur together in the same patient. \u2022 Valvular insufficiency results in ipsilateral atrial dilation, eccentric hypertrophy of the associated ventricle, and, if severe, signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). Cardiomyopathy of chronic volume overload and elevated atrial pressures are the end result, culminating in pulmonary congestion (with mitral valve dysplasia [MVD]) or systemic congestion (with tricuspid valve dysplasia [TVD]). \u2022 Valvular stenosis results in atrial dilation and hypertrophy and, if severe, hypoplasia of the receiving ventricle. The end result is atrial pressure elevation, also resulting in pulmonary congestion (mitral stenosis) or systemic congestion (tricuspid stenosis). Right-to-left shunting may occur in cases of tricuspid stenosis if there is an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication in animals with mitral valve stenosis. \u2022 Dynamic outflow tract obstruction may occur in patients with MVD, with resultant concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy that is proportional to the severity of the obstruction. \u2022 Ebstein\u2019s anomaly is a rare form of TVD, characterized by apical displacement of the basal tricuspid leaflet attachments and resultant right atrial (RA) enlargement, with a small right ventricle (\u201catrialized\u201d right ventricle). It can be accompanied by varying degrees of insufficiency or stenosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014chronic volume overload from valvular insufficiency and/or inflow obstruction due to valvular stenosis result in elevated pulmonary (MVD) or systemic (TVD) venous pressures. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014pulmonary edema may develop secondary to MVD; pulmonary hypertension is a common complication in animals with mitral stenosis. \u2022 Neurologic\u2014collapse and/or loss of consciousness, most often with exercise, may occur with severe disease due to low cardiac output/ hypotension or ventricular arrhythmias in cases with severe dynamic outflow obstruction. GENETICS TVD appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in dogues de Bordeaux and an autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance trait in Labrador retrievers. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE These are common congenital cardiac anomalies in cats (17% of reported congenital cardiac defects in one study). Mitral valve malformations often are noted in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Less frequently diagnosed in dogs. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 TVD\u2014increased risk for Labrador retriever, German shepherd dog, great Pyrenees, possibly Old English sheepdog; also common in cats. \u2022 MVD\u2014increased risk in bull terrier, Newfoundland, Labrador retriever, Great Dane, golden retriever, Dalmatian, and Siamese cat.

Physical Examination Findings \u2022 A holosystolic murmur is heard over the ipsilateral cardiac apex. In severe cases the murmur is accompanied by a thrill or gallop heart sounds. In animals with valvular stenosis, a soft diastolic murmur may be present in the same location, but many have no audible murmur. A labile systolic ejection murmur may be audible in animals with dynamic outflow tract obstruction. Silent tricuspid regurgitation is well documented in cats with a large regurgitant orifice and laminar regurgitant flow. \u2022 Jugular venous distension/pulsation may be evident in patients with TVD. \u2022 Evidence of left CHF (tachypnea, dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, cyanosis) in animals with severe MVD. \u2022 Evidence of right CHF (ascites, peripheral edema) with severe TVD.", "Atrioventricular Valvular Stenosis": " Atrioventricular (AV) valvular stenosis is a pathologic narrowing of the mitral or tricuspid valve orifice or the presence of an obstructive, supravalvular ring. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 AV stenosis increases the resistance to ventricular filling. \u2022 Ventricular filling in clinically significant disease requires a persistent diastolic pressure gradient between atrium and ventricle. \u2022 Concomitant valvular regurgitation is common. \u2022 The increased atrial pressure leads to atrial dilation, venous congestion, and often to congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary edema occurs with mitral stenosis (MS); whereas ascites, pleural effusion, and chylo - thorax can develop in cases of severe tricuspid stenosis (TS). \u2022 The foramen ovale can remain patent (PFO) in patients with TS, allowing right- to-left shunting with signs of cyanotic heart disease. \u2022 Partial AV septal defect (primum atrial septal defect [ASD] and abnormal AV valve) is observed in some cats with supravalvular mitral (ring) stenosis. \u2022 Cardiac output and therefore exercise capacity are limited. \u2022 The atrial pressure increases disproportionally with faster heart rates, thereby creating the risk for \u201cflash\u201d pulmonary edema in dogs or cats with MS. \u2022 Development of atrial tachyarrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), is associated with cardiac decompensation. \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can develop consequent to MS, leading to exercise intolerance and right ventricular hypertrophy. This can be severe, especially in cats. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014with MS: bronchial compression from enlarged left atrium, pulmonary edema from left heart failure; potential for hemoptysis due to rupture of pulmonary venous\u2013bronchial venous connections; pleural effusion with atelectasis in TS or in longstanding MS complicated by PH or AF. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014with TS: hepatic congestion, ascites. GENETICS \u2022 Uncertain in most cases. \u2022 Tricuspid valve dysplasia in Labrador retrievers has been localized to a defect in dog chromosome 9, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance.

RISK FACTORS Breed predispositions (see above); see Risk Factors for Endocarditis, Infective; permanent transvenous pacing.", "Azotemia and Uremia": " \u2022 Azotemia is an excess of urea, creatinine, or other nonprotein nitrogenous substances in blood, plasma, or serum. \u2022 Uremia is the polysystemic toxic syndrome resulting from marked loss in kidney functions. Uremia occurs simultaneously in animals with increased quantities of urine constituents in blood (azotemia), but azotemia may occur in the absence of uremia. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Azotemia can be caused by (1) increased production of nonprotein nitrogenous substances, (2) decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or (3) reabsorption of urine that has escaped from the urinary tract into the bloodstream. High production of nonprotein nitrogenous waste substances may result from high intake of protein (diet or gastrointestinal bleeding) or accelerated catabolism of endo - genous proteins. GFR may decline because of reduced renal perfusion (prerenal azotemia), acute or chronic kidney disease (renal azotemia), or urinary obstruction (postrenal azotemia). Reabsorption of urine into the systemic circulation may also result from leakage of urine from the excretory pathways (also a form of postrenal azotemia). \u2022 Pathophysiology of uremia\u2014incompletely understood; may be related to (1) metabolic and toxic systemic effects of waste products retained because of renal excretory failure, (2) deranged renal regulation of fluid, electrolytes, and acid-base balance, and (3) impaired renal production and degradation of hormones and other substances (e.g., erythropoietin and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol).

The normal aboral gastric and intestinal motility and functional pylorus prevent the reflux of bile back into the stomach. When bile is refluxed into the stomach it is normally rapidly removed by subsequent peristaltic contractions. Bile remaining in the gastric lumen along with gastric acid and pepsin can subsequently cause gastric mucosal damage. \u2022 Clinical signs often occur early in the morning, suggesting that prolonged fasting or gastric inactivity may modify normal motility patterns, resulting in bile reflux. \u2022 System affected\u2014GI.

Hypoplastic trachea can also be present and worsen respiratory distress. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In normal dogs, the upper airway accounts for 50\u201370% of total airway resistance. Brachy \u00ad cephalic breeds have increased upper airway resistance due to stenosis of nares, aberrant formation of nasal conchae, and presence of nasopharyngeal turbinates. Skull bones are shortened in length but normal in width, and soft tissues are not proportionately reduced, resulting in redundant tissue and narrowed air passages. \u2022 Increased airway resistance leads to more negative intra\u00adairway pressures\u2014may result in secondary eversion of laryngeal saccules, further elongation of palate, and laryngeal collapse. \u2022 Recruitment of pharyngeal dilator muscles (sternohyoid) becomes necessary to maintain airway patency; sleep apnea may occur secondary to relaxation of these muscles. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014respiratory distress, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hyperthermia, aspiration pneumonia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema from airway obstruction. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014cardiovascular collapse if complete airway obstruction or severe hyper\u00ad thermia occurs. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014may be reluctant to eat or drink; increased airway resistance can exacerbate hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, and esophagitis.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Brain tumors result in cerebral dysfunction by causing both primary effects, such as infiltration of nervous tissue or compression of adjacent anatomic structures, and secondary effects, such as hydrocephalus. \u2022 Additional primary effects include disruption of cerebral circulation and local necrosis, which may result in further damage to neural tissue. \u2022 The most important secondary effects of a primary brain tumor include disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral edema, or brain herniation. \u2022 Secondary effects usually are more diffuse or generalized in their clinical manifestations and may mask the precise location of a focal intracranial lesion. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nervous (brain). GENETICS \u2022 An unusually high incidence of meningiomas has been reported in cats with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. \u2022 Specific genetic factors associated with breed predisposition have not been identified. \u2022 Brachycephaly provisionally has been associated with the SMOC -2 and thrombospondin-2 genes on canine chromosome 1, and a component of glioma susceptibility provisionally has been mapped to a region on canine chromosome 2. \u2022 Molecular and genetic classification of brain tumors may permit targeted therapies in the future. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Brain tumors appear to be more common in dogs than in other domestic species. \u2022 Reported incidence in dogs is 10\u201320 per 100,000 animals, or 1\u20133% of all deaths where necropsy was done. \u2022 Primary nervous system tumors in dogs account for 60\u201380% of all such tumors reported in domestic animals (10\u201320% in cats; 10\u201320% in other species). \u2022 The most common sites for neoplasia to occur in immature dogs ( < 6 months), in decreasing order, are the hematopoietic system, brain, and skin. \u2022 Reported incidence in cats is 3.5/100000. SIGNALMENT Breed Predilections \u2022 Meningiomas occur most frequently in dolichocephalic breeds of dog. \u2022 Glial cell tumors and pituitary tumors occur commonly in brachycephalic breeds of dog. \u2022 Canine breeds overrepresented include boxer, golden retriever, Doberman pinscher, Scottish terrier, and Old English sheepdog. \u2022 There does not appear to be a breed predisposition for development of brain tumors in cats. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Brain tumors occur in dogs and cats of any age. \u2022 Most frequent in older dogs, with greatest incidence in dogs > 5 years of age. \u2022 Median age for diagnosis of meningiomas, gliomas, and choroid plexus tumors in dogs has been reported as 10\u201311 years, 8 years, and 5\u20136 years, respectively. Predominant Sex Older male cats appear to be most susceptible to meningiomas. SIGNS \u2022 Vary with tumor location. \u2022 The most frequently recognized clinical sign associated with a brain tumor of a dog or cat is seizures, particularly should first seizure occur after 5 years of age. \u2022 Other clinical signs frequently associated with brain tumor are abnormal behavior and mentation, visual deficits, circling, ataxia, head tilt, and cervical spinal hyperesthesia. \u2022 Signs that result from disease in given location in nervous system are similar, regardless of precise cause. \u2022 On basis of signalment, history, and results of complete physical and neurologic examinations, it is possible to localize a problem to the brain and, in some cases, to determine the approx - imate location. CAUSES \u2022 Uncertain. \u2022 Dietary, environmental, genetic, chemical, viral, traumatic, and immunologic factors may be considered.", "Breeding, Timing": " Timing of insemination(s) to maximize pregnancy risk and litter size. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Dogs \u2022 Must determine ovulation day so that breeding(s) occur(s) at proper time. \u2022 Fresh, chilled, or frozen semen\u2014usually limited to one or two inseminations; insemination must be timed relative to ovulation for maximum fertility. \u2022 Ovulation may vary relative to onset of heat (proestrus), standing heat (estrus), vaginal cytology. \u2022 Luteinizing hormone (LH)\u2014controls ovulation; peaks on same day or after full cornification is observed; ovulation occurs approximately 2 days after peak; 2\u20133 days (54\u201372 hours) more required for oocyte maturation; mature oocytes viable for minimum 2\u20133 days; thus fertile period is 4\u20138 days after LH peak, and maximum fertility is 5\u20136 days after LH peak. \u2022 Serum progesterone concentration\u2014 increase closely associated with LH peak. Cats \u2022 Ovulation\u2014usually induced; timing of breeding is not as critical as with dogs; depends on adequate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and then LH release triggered by vaginal stimulation. \u2022 Adequate stimulation\u2014 characterized by copulatory cry and postcoital reaction; frequency of coital stimuli important in determining adequacy of coital contact. \u2022 LH\u2014peak concentration and duration of elevation determine number of follicles ovulating; higher concentration with multiple copulations; response to copulation depends on day of estrus (greater release on estrus day 3 than on estrus day 1); release partially depends on duration of exposure to estrogen. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Reproductive GENETICS Not applicable INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Not applicable GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Dog and cat. SIGNS General Comments Dogs \u2022 Onset of estrus\u2014usually associated with a change in the vaginal discharge from sanguineous to barely red and decreased vulvar edema; sanguineous discharge may continue during estrus and cease only at the onset of diestrus. \u2022 Physical signs alone\u2014 unreliable for precise determination of fertile period. \u2022 Receptivity\u2014may be detected by touching the perineum near the vulva; if receptive, female will \u201cflag\u201d by elevating the tail to one side and lifting the vulva dorsally. Cats LH response to a single mating\u2014may vary substantially. Historical Findings Dogs Sanguineous vulvar discharge during estrus. Cats Return to estrus in < 30 days may indicate failure to ovulate; interestrus usually 8\u201310 days, but highly variable even within queen; some queens will breed while pregnant. Physical Examination Findings Dogs \u2022 Interest shown by male. \u2022 Vulva less turgid. \u2022 Vaginal discharge\u2014less color and amount. \u2022 Flagging. \u2022 Females show mounting behavior. \u2022 Fully cornified and crenulated pale vaginal epithelium. \u2022 Digital palpation of vagina may be resented by bitch in proestrus, improving throughout proestrus until estrus.

Mutations in SOD1 are known to cause some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Initial signs of progressive upper motor neuron spastic paresis and general proprioceptive ataxia in the pelvic limbs occur in older dogs. If euthanasia is delayed, clinical signs progress to flaccid tetraparesis/plegia and other lower motor neuron signs. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 A c.118 G>A transition in Exon 2 of SOD1 that predicts an E40K missense mutation underlies most degenerative myelopathy (DM); a second SOD1 missense mutation ( c.52 A>T ) has been seen only in Bernese mountain dogs. \u2022 Lesions may represent a multisystem central-peripheral axonopathy. \u2022 Predilection for lesion severity in midthoracic spinal cord may be a result of lower percentages of radicular artery contributions and small-diameter vessels when compared to other spinal cord regions. \u2022 Paucity of vascular supply in thoracic spinal cord may predispose it to damage from oxidative and metabolic disturbances. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Central and peripheral nervous systems. \u2022 Thoracolumbar spinal cord in early stage. \u2022 Progresses to involve the cervical and lumbar spinal cord and peripheral nervous system later in the course of the disease. \u2022 Neurons in the brainstem also may be affected. \u2022 Disease also involves the sensory nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. GENETICS \u2022 Most commonly autosomal recessive inheritance. \u2022 Due to preponderance of purebred dogs affected, a familial inheritance is currently suspected. \u2022 Mutations in SOD1 are causative for DM but are incompletely penetrant. \u2022 Dogs that are homozygous for the mutant allele are at highest risk for developing DM; not all dogs that test homozygous for the mutation will develop DM, but dogs that test normal (clear) are highly unlikely to develop DM; dogs that test carrier are less likely to develop DM, but this has been documented in some breeds. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Prevalence rate of DM reported for all dogs collected from the Veterinary Medical Database (1990\u20131999) was 0.19%. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide SIGNALMENT Breed Predilections So far the DM-associated SOD1:c.118A allele is in >150 breeds or varieties; a second SOD1 mutation ( c.52 A>T ) was found only in Bernese mountain dogs.

Genetic studies in feline ARVC are lacking.", "Cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular\u2014Dogs": " A myocardial disease commonly characterized by ventricular tachyarrhythmias that can be accompanied by syncope or sudden death. A small percentage (<5%) develop congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, comparable to the dilated cardiomyopathy observed in other breeds. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog. \u2022 Specific to the boxer, although a similar presentation is infrequently observed in the English bulldog. \u2022 Usually observed in mature dogs between 5 and 8 years of age. Dogs as young as 6 months have been reported and some affected dogs may not develop clinical signs until > 10 years of age. SIGNS \u2022 Usually one of three presentations: \u25e6 Asymptomatic dog with ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) detected on routine examination. \u25e6 Syncope with VPCs detected on ECG or Holter monitor. \u25e6 Signs of left heart failure (e.g., tachypnea, coughing) or biventricular failure (e.g., ascites, tachypnea, coughing) with VPCs; this presentation is least common. \u2022 Sudden death may occur before development of obvious clinical signs. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Adult onset, inherited (autosomal dominant). \u2022 A genetic mutation (deletion) in a cardiac desmosomal gene (striatin) is associated with the development of the disease. Dogs that are homozygous for the striatin deletion appear to be more likely to be more severely affected with a higher number of VPCs, and are more likely to have cardiac dilation and myocardial dysfunction. Sudden death is more common. It is not yet known if this is the only genetic cause or if additional genetic mutations will be identified. \u2022 At least one family of boxers with VPCs, ventricular dilation, and systolic dysfunction was found to have decreased myocardial l\u00adcarnitine levels and demonstrated some clinical improvement when supplemented with l\u00adcarnitine. The cause and effect of this relationship is unclear, and response to this supplementation does not occur in all dogs with myocardial dysfunction.", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated\u2014Cats": " \u2022 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle characterized by systolic myocardial failure and a dilated, volumeoverloaded heart that leads to signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) or low cardiac output. \u2022 Before 1987, DCM was the second most commonly diagnosed heart disease in cats. Most cats had a secondary DCM as a result of taurine deficiency. Primary idiopathic DCM is now an uncommon cause of heart disease in cats. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Histopathologically, the myocardium of cats with idiopathic DCM has evidence of myocytolysis, fibrosis, myofibril fragmentation, and vacuolization. Gross examination reveals global eccentric enlargement of all four cardiac chambers. \u2022 These anatomic changes are associated with progressive myocardial systolic failure, decreased contractility, decreased compliance, and secondary mitral valve regurgitation due to mitral valve annular dilation. These changes are typically identified by echocardiography. \u2022 Eventually, the chronic myocardial dysfunction leads to CHF and clinical signs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014DCM is a primary myocardial disease and primarily affects the heart and its ability to maintain an adequate cardiac output to maintain the body\u2019s needs. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014cats with DCM can present with aortic thromboembolism (ATE), which causes acute paraparesis or monoparesis. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014cats with DCM and CHF often have poor renal perfusion and commonly have prerenal azotemia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014cats usually present with tachypnea or dyspnea due to CHF with DCM. These cats can develop both pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. GENETICS Because of the human experience with DCM, it is likely that feline DCM also has a genetic basis, either inherited or de novo, as the cause of the disease. No definitive mutation has been identified in the cat to date; however, a quantitative genetic evaluation of a large cattery suggested an inherited factor in the development of DCM. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Idiopathic feline DCM is relatively uncommon now that taurine is adequately supplemented in cat foods. A retrospective survey of 106 cats with feline myocardial disease from 1994 to 2001 from Europe revealed that DCM was diagnosed in approximately 10% of the cases in this series. In the author\u2019s experience, the prevalence of feline idiopathic DCM may be less than 10%.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Myocardial failure leads to reduced cardiac output and congestive heart failure (CHF). \u2022 Atrioventricular (AV) annulus dilation and altered papillary muscle function promote valvular insufficiency. \u2022 Although left\u00adsided signs commonly predominate, evidence of severe right\u00adsided disease can occur and infrequently is the dominant clinical scenario. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014prerenal azotemia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014pulmonary edema, infrequently pulmonary hypertension. \u2022 All organ systems are affected by reductions in cardiac output. GENETICS \u2022 Genetic cause or heritable susceptibility strongly suspected in most breeds and documented in some (Portuguese water dog, boxer, and Doberman pinscher) with variable forms of inheritance. \u2022 A genetic test is commercially available for causative mutations in boxer dogs (striatin) and Doberman pinscher (NCSU DCM 1\u2014 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; NCSU DCM 2\u2014titin). \u2022 These mutations are not causative in other predisposed breeds in which they have been evaluated. \u2022 Correlations between genotype and phenotype have shown that Doberman pinschers with both mutations have, on average, an earlier onset of clinical disease with a predisposition to sudden death; boxers homozygous for the mutation are more likely to develop the DCM phenotype. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Estimated at 0.5\u20131.1% in predisposed breeds and perhaps higher in specific geographic regions. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None with the exception of Chagas\u2019 cardiomyopathy, which is limited to the southern United States (Gulf Coast) and both Central and South America.

Mean Age and Range 4\u201310 years. Predominant Sex Males > females in most but not all breeds (minor predisposition). SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea, dyspnea, coughing. \u2022 Weight loss, typically of lean muscle mass. \u2022 Weakness, lethargy, anorexia. \u2022 Abdominal distention. \u2022 Syncope, usually associated with arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation; ventricular tachycardia). \u2022 Some dogs are asymptomatic, having what is termed preclinical DCM, the diagnosis of which in specific breeds is well described. \u2022 Breed\u00adspecific echocardiographic parameters coupled with cardiac biomarkers (NT\u00adproBNP; cardiac troponin I [cTnI]) may help identify dogs with preclinical DCM. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May be completely normal with preclinical DCM. \u2022 Weakness, possibly cardiogenic shock. \u2022 Hypokinetic femoral pulse from low cardiac output. \u2022 Pulse deficits with atrial fibrillation, ventricular or supraventricular premature contractions, and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. \u2022 Jugular pulses from tricuspid regurgitation, arrhythmias, or right\u00adsided CHF. \u2022 Breath sounds\u2014muffled with pleural effusion; crackles with pulmonary edema. \u2022 S3 or summation gallop sounds. \u2022 Mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation murmurs are common but usually focal and soft. \u2022 Auscultatory evidence of cardiac arrhythmia is common. \u2022 Slow capillary refill time, infrequent cyanosis. \u2022 Hepatomegaly with or without ascites. CAUSES \u2022 Majority of cases represent familial abnormalities of structural, energetic, or contractile cardiac proteins, some of which have been identified. \u2022 Nutritional deficiencies (taurine and/or carnitine) have been documented in several breeds including golden retriever, boxer, Newfoundland, and cocker spaniel; dietassociated DCM, which may be associated with taurine deficiency, commonly secondary to boutique, exotic\u00adingredient, or grain free (BEG) diets, is increasing recognized and potentially reversible. \u2022 Viral, protozoal, and immune\u00admediated mechanisms have been proposed but not proven. \u2022 Doxorubicin toxicity. \u2022 Hypothyroidism and persistent tachyarrhythmias (sometimes associated with congenital tricuspid valve malformation) may cause reversible myocardial failure.", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic\u2014Cats": " Inappropriate concentric hypertrophy of the ventricular free wall and/or the interventricular septum of the nondilated left ventricle. The disease occurs independently of other cardiac or systemic disorders. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Diastolic dysfunction results from a thickened, less compliant left ventricle. \u2022 High left ventricular filling pressure develops, causing left atrial (LA) enlarge - ment. \u2022 Pulmonary venous hypertension causes pulmonary edema. Some cats develop biventricular failure (i.e., pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, small volume pericardial effusion without tamponade, and infrequently ascites). \u2022 Stasis of blood in the large left atrium predisposes the patient to aortic thromboembolism (ATE). \u2022 Dynamic aortic outflow obstruction and systolic anterior mitral motion (SAM) with secondary mitral insufficiency may occur, but unlike in humans, appears not to affect prognosis. \u2022 Recent evidence suggests that some cats with apparent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and congestive heart failure (CHF) actually have transient myocardial thickening, often associated with high serum troponin I concentrations. These cats are younger than average for HCM, with on average less severe left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and they can experience resolution of both CHF and LV hypertrophy.

GENETICS Some families of cats have been identified with a high prevalence of the disease, and the disease appears to be an autosomal dominant trait in Maine coon cats and ragdoll cats, due to a mutation in the myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) gene. The genetics have not been definitively determined in other breeds; however, the Maine coon and ragdoll mutations have not been identified in affected Sphynx, Norwegian forest cats, Bengals, Siberians, or British shorthair cats. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Unknown, but relatively common. May be as high as 15% of the population.

Mean Age and Range \u2022 5\u20137 years, with reported ages of 3 months\u2013 17 years. Some breeds of cats including ragdolls and Sphynx may develop the disease at a younger age (average of 2 years). \u2022 HCM is most often a disease of young to middle-aged cats; unexplained murmurs in geriatric cats are more likely associated with hyperthyroidism or hypertension. Predominant Sex Male SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Dyspnea, tachypnea. \u2022 Anorexia. \u2022 Exercise intolerance. \u2022 Vomiting. \u2022 Collapse. \u2022 Sudden death. \u2022 Coughing is uncommon in cats with HCM and suggests primary pulmonary disease. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Gallop rhythm (S3 or S4). \u2022 Systolic murmur in approximately half of affected cats. \u2022 Apex heartbeat may be exaggerated. \u2022 Muffled heart sounds, lack of chest compliance, and dyspnea characterized by rapid shallow respirations may be associated with pleural effusion. \u2022 Dyspnea and crackles if pulmonary edema is present. \u2022 Weak femoral pulse. \u2022 Acute pelvic limb paralysis with cyanotic pads and nailbeds, cold limbs, and absence of femoral pulse in animals with ATE; emboli rarely affect thoracic limbs. \u2022 Arrhythmia in some animals. \u2022 May have no clinical signs.

Possible Causes \u2022 Abnormalities of contractile protein myosin or other sarcomeric proteins (e.g., troponin, myosin-binding proteins, tropomyosin). \u2022 Abnormality affecting catecholamineinfluenced excitation contraction coupling. \u2022 Abnormal myocardial calcium metabolism. \u2022 Collagen or other intercellular matrix abnormality. \u2022 Growth hormone excess. \u2022 Dynamic LV outflow obstruction may contribute to secondary LV hypertrophy. RISK FACTORS Offspring of animals with familial mutations of MyBPC.", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic\u2014Dogs": " Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as inappropriate myocardial hypertrophy of a nondilated left ventricle, occurring in the absence of an identifiable stimulus. HCM is rare in dogs, and is characterized by left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy (increased wall thickness). The primary disease process is confined to the heart and only affects other organ systems when congestive heart failure (CHF) is present. Increased LV wall thickness leads to impaired ventricular filling (due to lack of compliance and abnormal relaxation), with resultant increases in LV end-diastolic pressure and left atrial (LA) pressure. LA enlargement is usually in response to increased LV end-diastolic pressure. Mitral insufficiency and/or dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction commonly occur secondary to structural and/or functional changes of the mitral valve apparatus caused by papillary muscle malalignment due to hyper - trophy. SIGNALMENT \u2022 The incidence of HCM in dogs is very low, thus accurate accounts of signalment are lacking. \u2022 Young (<3 years) male dogs. \u2022 Rottweiler, Dalmatian, German shepherd, pointer breeds and Boston terriers have been reported. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Most are asymptomatic. \u2022 Signs of left CHF predominate in sympto - matic dogs. \u2022 Syncope, generally during activity or exercise. \u2022 Sudden death is the most commonly reported clinical sign.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS The cause of canine HCM is unknown. Genetic abnormalities in genes coding for myocardial contractile proteins have been documented in humans and cats.", "Cardiomyopathy, Nutritional": " \u2022 Nutritional imbalances, such as taurine and L-carnitine deficiency, can lead to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in some dogs and cats. Deficiencies of other nutrients (e.g., selenium, zinc, vitamin E, thiamine, copper, iron) or nutrient toxicities (e.g., iron, cobalt) also have the potential to alter myocardial function, resulting in clinical manifestations of heart disease. Additionally, relative nutritional deficiencies or toxicities may interact with other toxic, infectious, or genetic insults in certain individuals to produce DCM. \u2022 Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid found in cardiac muscle, playing an important role in myocardial calcium regulation. Taurine deficiency was first reported as a cause of reversible DCM in cats in 1987, prompting an increase in the dietary taurine requirement for commercial cat foods, and since then DCM in cats is uncommon. Unlike cats, dogs should be able to endogenously synthesize taurine; however, several breeds (e.g., American cocker spaniel, Newfoundland, Irish wolfhound, golden retriever) have reported predispositions to taurine deficiency and resultant DCM. Additionally, some commercial dog foods such as grain-free, high-legume, lamb and rice formulations and high-fiber foods, have been associated with taurine deficiency. Oral taurine supplementation can effect disease reversal in deficient cats and significant improvement in dogs. \u2022 L-carnitine, a quaternary amine, is an important part of enzyme systems that transport fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidization to make energy. It also has other important cellular metabolic and scavenging functions. Carnitine deficiency complicates some cases of DCM in dogs. Plasma L-carnitine deficiency in association with cardiomyopathy does not mean that the deficiency is the sole cause of the myopathy, although correcting the deficiency, if possible, makes medical and physiologic sense. In the dog, dietary carnitine intake influences plasma concentrations significantly, and oral carnitine supplementation is usually an effective means of raising plasma and subsequently muscle carnitine levels. \u2022 A perceived increase in recognition of DCM in dogs eating boutique, exoticingredient, or grain-free (BEG) dog foods in 2018 prompted an FDA investigation into a possible relationship between BEG diets and canine DCM. The majority of affected dogs eating BEG diets do not appear to be taurine or L-carnitine deficient; however, golden retrievers appear to be more susceptible to taurine deficiency when eating these foods. The underlying cause has not yet (as of writing) been identified, and causation has not been proven. Nutritional management, involving diet change and in some cases taurine supplementation, has resulted in improvement or resolution of cardiomyopathy over a period of 3\u201312 months. Investigations are ongoing. SIGNALMENT Dogs \u2022 Golden retrievers, American cocker spaniels, Newfoundlands, English setters, St. Bernards, and Irish wolfhounds are reported to be predisposed to taurine-deficient DCM. \u2022 L-carnitine deficiency has been reported in a family of boxers. \u2022 Dogs eating BEG diets that are affected with suspected nutritional DCM have been of varied ages and breeds. Cats Taurine deficiency is rare in cats fed commercial, nutritionally balanced diets. Taurine-deficient DCM can occur in cats fed vegetarian or home-prepared diets. SIGNS \u2022 Clinical signs of taurine-deficient DCM are related to poor myocardial contractility, which can lead to congestive heart failure in some cases; these signs include lethargy, weakness, syncope, dyspnea and tachypnea. \u2022 Cats may also present for reproductive failure, poor growth, or blindness due to central retinal degeneration. \u2022 Clinical signs of carnitine deficiency can be diverse, ranging from clinical manifestations of DCM to skeletal muscle pain and exercise intolerance. \u2022 See Cardiomyopathy, Dilated\u2014Dogs. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Vegetarian and home-prepared diets increase the risk of taurine-deficient DCM in cats if taurine is not exogenously supplemented adequately. \u2022 Factors predisposing to taurine deficiency in dogs include breed (possible genetic causes) and dietary components; high-fiber diets, low-protein diets, lamb and rice diets, and beet pulp ingredients have been associated with taurine deficiency; dietary predisposition to taurine deficiency with these factors could be a result of inadequate taurine precursors (methionine and cysteine), low bioavailability of taurine and/or precursors, reduced entero- hepatic bile acid recycling due to high dietary fiber, excessive urinary taurine wasting, or gastrointestinal microbial interaction with taurine. \u2022 Some dogs with DCM have been documented to have carnitine transport defects, in which muscle carnitine is low despite adequate plasma concentrations. In cases in which a mitochondrial enzyme defect causes the accumulation of a metabolite to toxic levels within the mitochondria (e.g., multiple Co-A dehydrogenase defects), free L-carnitine is used to \u201cscavenge\u201d potentially toxic excess metabolites, which appear harmlessly in the plasma and eventually the urine as carnitine esters; in these cases, the total amount of carnitine (free carnitine plus that esterified to other molecules) in the plasma or muscle may be normal or even high, but the ratio of free to esterified carnitine is decreased; this situation is known as carnitine insufficiency (since although the concentration of free carnitine may be within the normal range, it is insufficient to meet the body\u2019s pathologically increased need for free carnitine). \u2022 Certain families of boxers appear to be at especially high risk of developing symptomatic DCM in association with, and probably caused by, carnitine deficiency; a known first-degree relative with cardiomyopathy should increase the index of suspicion. \u2022 The cause of the apparent, although unproven, link between BEG diets and canine DCM is unknown; however, the commonality of ingredients in these diets has drawn the attention of veterinary nutritionists; the high legume content of these foods (e.g., lentils and peas), less studied protein sources (e.g., kangaroo, alligator, bison), and other unusual ingredients (e.g., flaxseed) raise the possibility of a nutrient deficiency, toxicity, or nutrient\u2013 nutrient interaction that may predispose to the development of DCM in some dogs.", "Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive\u2014Cats": " A rare, primary heart muscle disease character - ized functionally by severe diastolic dysfunction with restrictive left ventricular (LV) filling and normal to near normal systolic function, morphologically by a nondilated, nonhypertrophied left ventricle with increased endocardial and/or myocardial fibrosis and severe atrial enlargement, and clinically by congestive heart failure (CHF), thromboembolic disease, and cardiac death. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Increased cardiomyofilament Ca 2+ sensitivity leading to severely impaired myocardial relaxation, high myocardial stiffness due to endomyocardial fibrosis (endomyocardial type) and/or interstitial fibrosis (myocardial type), and disorganized myofiber architecture (disarray) are main characteristics of primary restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM); RCM-like myocardial changes and clinical syndromes can result from myocardial remodeling and dysfunction secondary to other causes (e.g., endomyocarditis, immune-mediated disease, or end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). \u2022 Diastolic heart failure and cardiogenic arterial thromboembolism (ATE) lead to high mortality.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The normal lens is composed of perfectly aligned lens fibers that create a transparent structure. A clear capsule surrounds the cortex and nucleus. New lens fibers are continually produced at the equator of the lens cortex throughout life. The aqueous humor provides nutrition to the lens. \u2022 A cataract occurs when there is derangement of lens fibers due to changes in lens nutrition, energy metabolism, protein synthesis or metabolism, or osmotic balance. \u2022 Anterior uveitis is a common cause of altered lens nutrition. \u2022 Genetics can result in altered protein and energy metabolism, or protein synthesis, in the lens. \u2022 Diabetes mellitus affects the osmotic balance in the lens. Hyperglycemia increases glucose in the aqueous and lens overwhelming the glycolysis pathway; glucose is shunted to the sorbitol pathway; sorbitol creates an osmotic gradient that draws water into the lens and rapid cataract formation. The sorbitol pathway requires aldose reductase enzyme and dogs have more aldose reductase than cats, making cats more resistant to developing diabetic cataracts. The enzyme levels vary between individuals, which may explain dogs that are resistant to cataract development. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Ophthalmic GENETICS \u2022 Inheritance has been established for many dog breeds; the most common mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. \u2022 Inheritance has been established in the Himalayan cat (autosomal recessive).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Compressive lesion caused by intervertebral disc herniation, osseous malformation, thickened ligaments, or a combination, in a stenotic vertebral canal. \u2022 Disc-associated compression\u2014dogs > 3 years; intervertebral disc degeneration and subsequent protrusion might be secondary to abnormal articular facet articulation in Doberman pinschers, which predisposes to increased rotational strain in the intervertebral discs. \u2022 Vertebral malformation (bony-associated compression)\u2014most commonly seen in giant breeds of dogs, usually in young adult dogs (<4 years); the osseous malformation can compress the spinal cord dorsoventrally (vertebral arch malformation), dorsolaterally (articular process malformation/osteoarthritic lesions), or laterally (pedicular malformation/osteoarthritic lesions). \u2022 Dynamic spinal cord compression (one that changes with movements of the cervical spine) is always a component of the pathophysiology with any type of compression. \u2022 Current evidence does not suggest that instability has a primary role in the pathogenesis of CSM. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nervous GENETICS \u2022 Heritable basis proposed for borzoi and basset hound. \u2022 Recent evidence suggests that the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (with incomplete penetrance) in Doberman pinscher. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE CSM is probably the most common neurologic disorder of the cervical spine of large- and giant-breed dogs. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Breed Predilections \u2022 Doberman pinscher and Great Dane are the most commonly affected breeds, with approximately 60\u201370% of cases seen in these breeds. \u2022 Other breeds with a high incidence include Rottweiler, German shepherd, Weimaraner, Labrador, and Dalmatian. \u2022 CSM can be seen in any breed, including small-breed dogs. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Doberman pinschers and other large-breed dogs are usually presented > 3 years of age, with a mean age of 6 years. \u2022 Giant-breed dogs are usually presented <3 years of age, although late presentations can be seen. Predominant Sex Males overrepresented, primarily in giantbreed dogs. SIGNS General Comments The classic clinical presentation is a slowly progressive pelvic limb ataxia with less severe thoracic limb involvement. Historical Findings \u2022 Chronic, slowly progressive gait dysfunction is characteristic; acute presentations are usually associated with neck pain; occasionally, acute worsening of a dog with chronic history is observed. \u2022 Neck pain or cervical hyperesthesia is a common historical finding; it occurs in approximately 65\u201370% of Dobermans, and 40\u201350% of other breeds. Neurologic Examination Findings \u2022 Cervical pain is the primary complaint in only approximately 5% of patients. \u2022 Gait changes are characterized by proprioceptive ataxia and paresis (weakness); the ataxia and paresis are more obvious in the pelvic limbs, with lesions in the caudal cervical spine (C5\u20136, C6\u20137); compressive lesions in the mid-cervical spine tend to cause ataxia in all four limbs. \u2022 The thoracic limb gait can appear short- strided, spastic with a floating appearance, or very weak. \u2022 Proprioceptive positioning deficits are usually present, but dogs with chronic ataxia may not display them; the gait exam (presence of ataxia) provides a more sensitive indication of myelopathy than proprioceptive positioning deficits. \u2022 Dogs can present nonambulatory. \u2022 Supraspinatus muscle atrophy and worn toenails can be seen in some cases. \u2022 Extensor muscle tone is commonly increased in all four limbs. \u2022 Patellar reflexes are normal or increased; flexor reflex may be difficult to elicit in the thoracic limbs due to increased extensor tone. CAUSES \u2022 Nutrition\u2014excess protein, calcium, and caloric intake were proposed in Great Danes; nutrition does not appear to play a role in the development of CSM in large-breed dogs. \u2022 The cause of CSM is likely multifactorial. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Body conformation\u2014large head and long neck have been proposed, but later studies found no correlation between body dimensions and incidence of CSM. \u2022 Fast growth rate has been proposed, but not confirmed by other studies.", "Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis)": " \u2022 Caused by hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi . \u2022 Transmission through contact with infected feces of the Reduviid (\u201ckissing\u201d) bug, ingestion of bug vector, through blood transfusion, or vertical transmission to offspring. \u2022 After multiplication at entry site (5 days postinfection [PI]), hematogenous spread to heart, brain, and other organs. \u2022 Maximal parasitemia at 14 days PI; associated with acute myocarditis and (less commonly) encephalitis. \u2022 Infection becomes subpatent 30 days PI. \u2022 Dogs then enter long asymptomatic period (months to years); subset develop cardio- myopathy. \u2022 South and Central America\u2014endemic in humans and pets; infected animals are sentinels for human risk. \u2022 United States\u2014in southern states with infected vectors and reservoir hosts (raccoons, opossums, armadillos, mice, rats, squirrels).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Clostridium perfringens (CP) is a Grampositive, spore-forming, strictly anaerobic bacterium. \u2022 CP is a normal commensal organism found in the intestinal tract of humans and animals. \u2022 A strong link between canine acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS; formerly hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [HGE]) and the presence of CP has been identified. \u2022 Certain strains of CP (primarily Type A) produce a potent enterotoxin (CPE) as well as pore-forming toxins (NetE and NetF). \u2022 CPE is a cytotoxic enterotoxin that causes tissue destruction; it has been identified in the feces of up to 14% of dogs without diarrhea, thus its role in causing diarrhea is unclear. \u2022 NetF-producing CP isolates have not been found in healthy dogs. \u2022 Not all strains of CP produce CPE or NetF and not all dogs that have CPE in feces are clinical, therefore it is undetermined why some develop diarrhea. \u2022 CPE production is coregulated with sporulation of the organism; conditions that precipitate sporulation in animals include a sudden change in diet, dietary indiscretion, injudicious use of antibiotics causing a severe dysbiosis, and underlying intestinal disease. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Gastrointestinal (GI). INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Incidence is unknown; up to 34% of canine diarrhea cases are suspected to be CP related. The infection is far less common in cats. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Mean Age and Range Any age. SIGNS General Comments Can include both large and small bowel diarrhea. Historical Findings \u2022 Large bowel diarrhea\u2014tenesmus, mucous, frank blood, and increased frequency of defecation. \u2022 Small bowel diarrhea\u2014large volumes of soft to liquid diarrhea. \u2022 Vomiting and abdominal discomfort. \u2022 Severity varies from mild, self-limiting diarrhea to fatal, acute, hemorrhagic diarrhea. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Abdominal discomfort. \u2022 Hematochezia. \u2022 Mucoid feces. \u2022 Dehydration if there has been voluminous diarrhea or vomiting. \u2022 Fever is uncommon. \u2022 Evidence of systemic illness or debilitation is rare. CAUSES \u2022 In humans, CP-associated diarrhea is usually due to ingestion of enterotoxigenic isolates. In dogs, it is thought to be secondary to disruption of the intestinal microenvironment. \u2022 Anything that disrupts normal enteric microbiota can lead to CP overgrowth and diarrhea. \u2022 CP toxins have been implicated in dogs with AHDS. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Dietary changes. \u2022 Antibiotic use. \u2022 Stress. \u2022 Primary small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.", "Coagulation Factor Deficiency": " Hemostatic defects characterized by a lack of one or more procoagulant proteins (coagulation factors). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Coagulation involves a complex series of enzymatic reactions that generate a burst of thrombin (factor IIa) at sites of blood vessel injury; thrombin then cleaves plasma fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that subsequently polymerize and cross-link to form an insoluble fibrin clot. \u2022 Functional and/or quantitative coagulation factor deficiencies cause a failure of fibrin clot formation. \u2022 The liver is the sole or primary site of synthesis of most coagulation factors; after synthesis, factors II, VII, IX, and X require a vitamin K\u2013 dependent modification to become fully active. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Coagulation factor deficiency can cause spontaneous hemorrhage, prolonged post- traumatic hemorrhage, and ultimately blood loss anemia. \u2022 Spontaneous hemorrhage\u2014often develops in body cavities or potential spaces (i.e., hemothorax, hemoperitoneum, hemarthrosis, subcutaneous, or intramuscular hematoma). GENETICS \u2022 Hemophilia A and B (factor VIII and IX deficiencies)\u2014X-linked recessive traits. \u2022 All other factor deficiencies are autosomal traits. \u2022 Specific defects are more likely to be propagated within a single breed, but all breeds are at risk for developing new mutations. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Hereditary factor deficiencies\u2014severe defects manifest by 3\u20136 months of age, milder hemostatic defects manifest after surgery or trauma. \u2022 For X-linked recessive traits, males express the bleeding tendency, female carriers are clinically normal. \u2022 For autosomal traits, males and females express signs with equal frequency. \u2022 Hemophilia A is a common hereditary factor deficiency and may be seen in all breeds and mixed-breed dogs and cats. \u2022 Factor XII deficiency is common in cats, but does not cause a clinical bleeding tendency. \u2022 Acquired factor deficiencies\u2014depends on underlying disease process. SIGNS \u2022 Hematoma formation. \u2022 Intracavitary hemorrhage. \u2022 Prolonged hemorrhage after surgery or trauma. \u2022 Blood loss anemia. CAUSES \u2022 Acquired\u2014synthetic failure (liver disease); vitamin K deficiency (cholestasis, anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity, malabsorption, long-term antibiotics, coumadin); factor inhibition (anticoagulant overdose, envenomation, auto- or alloantibodies); factor consumption and depletion (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [DIC]); factor dilution (high-volume transfusion, crystalloid, or colloid fluid therapy); hyperfibrinolysis (secondary fibrinogen depletion). \u2022 Hereditary\u2014distinct mutations in coagulation factor genes.", "Coagulopathy of Liver Disease": " \u2022 The liver is the sole/primary site of synthesis of procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic proteins, except factors V, VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasmin - ogen activator (TPA). \u2022 Some patients develop prolonged in vitro clotting times, but few exhibit spontaneous bleeding. \u2022 Causes of hemostatic imbalance: \u25e6 reduced synthesis or activation of procoagulant proteins; \u25e6 vitamin K deficiency; \u25e6 dysfibrinogenemia due to abnormal fibrin polymerization; \u25e6 reduced clearance of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP); \u25e6 thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathy; \u25e6 enhanced fibrinolysis. \u2022 Vitamin K deficiency\u2014linked to severe intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis, steatorrhea, or prolonged oral antibiotic administration.

SIGNALMENT \u2022 In the United States, Chinese Shar-Pei have a high prevalence of cobalamin deficiency. Isolated families of other breeds, such as the giant schnauzer, beagle, border collie, and Australian shepherd dog, have also been described as having cobalamin deficiency. \u2022 No other breed, sex, or age predilections are known for canine or feline patients with cobalamin deficiency.

Cats Like dogs, although skin lesions are most common type of infection in cats. CAUSES C. immitis grows several inches deep in the soil, where it survives high ambient temperatures and low moisture. After a period of rainfall, the organism returns to the soil surface where it sporulates, releasing many arthroconidia that disseminate by wind and dust storms. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Aggressive nosing in contaminated soil and underbrush may expose susceptible animals to large numbers of arthroconidia. \u2022 Dust storms after the rainy season; increased incidence noted after earthquakes. \u2022 Land development with earth disruption may lead to increased exposure.", "Coccidiosis": " \u2022 An enteric infection, traditionally associated with Cystoisospora canis (dogs) and Cystoisospora felis (cats) as potential pathogens; other species of Cystoisospora may be present. \u2022 Strictly host specific (i.e., no cross-transmission). \u2022 Eimeria spp. are not parasitic for dogs or cats. \u2022 Cryptosporidium can cause an acute, life- threatening coccidiosis (cryptosporidiosis) in neonatal pups and kittens; can also cause non-life-threatening small bowel diarrhea in dogs and cats (see Cryptosporidiosis) \u2022 Voluminous watery diarrhea is characteristic; auto-infection and recycling within the intestinal tract result in a rapid loss of mucosal lining with cryptosporidiosis.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Inflammation of the colon causes accumulation of inflammatory cytokines, disrupts tight junctions between epithelial cells, stimulates colonic secretion, stimulates goblet cell secretion of mucus, and disrupts motility. \u2022 These mechanisms reduce the ability of the colon to absorb water and electrolytes, and store feces, which causes frequent diarrhea, often with mucus and/or frank blood. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Gastrointestinal GENETICS \u2022 Breeds predisposed to histiocytic ulcerative colitis (granulomatous colitis [GC]) include boxers, French bulldogs, and, less commonly, border collies. \u2022 German shepherd dogs are predisposed to perianal fistulae (anal furunculosis) that can be associated with colitis. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Approximately 30% of dogs with chronic diarrhea examined at one university hospital. \u2022 71% of dogs with a food-responsive enteropathy had clinical signs of colitis (either alone or in association with enteritis (entero - colitis). \u2022 Prevalence of colitis probably higher than perceived, because many diarrheic dogs and cats manifesting small bowel diarrhea have evidence of colitis histopathologically when biopsied.

SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Boxers, French bulldogs, border collies (GC). \u2022 German shepherd dogs\u2014perianal fistulas and concurrent colitis. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Any age; boxers and French bulldogs are typically younger (<2 years). \u2022 Cats infected with Tritrichomonas blagburni are typically younger (<2 years), but can also be infected when older. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Fecal consistency can be variable from semi-formed to liquid. \u2022 Marked increase in frequency of defecation (6\u201315 times per day) with small fecal volume. \u2022 Tenesmus. \u2022 Increased fecal mucus. \u2022 Hematochezia; cats may have formed feces with hematochezia. \u2022 Occasional dyschezia (painful defecation). \u2022 Increased urgency to defecate. \u2022 Vomiting in approximately 30% of dogs and cats with colitis. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Usually unremarkable. \u2022 Rectal examination may reveal thickened and irregular colorectal mucosa. \u2022 Dogs with GC may show systemic signs of weight loss and anorexia. CAUSES \u2022 Dietary\u2014food-responsive enteropathy is common and important cause of colitis; dietary indiscretion; food intolerance. \u2022 Drug administration (antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). \u2022 Infectious\u2014 Trichuris vulpis , Entamoeba histolytica , Balantidium coli , Tritrichomonas blagburni , Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile , Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli , Yersinia enterocolitica , Prototheca , Histoplasma capsulatum , pythiosis/ phycomycosis. \u2022 Traumatic\u2014foreign body, abrasive material. \u2022 Inflammatory\u2014secondary to pancreatitis (transverse colitis). \u2022 Inflammatory/ immune\u2014inflammatory bowel disease (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, granulomatous) colitis.", "Colitis, Histiocytic Ulcerative": " \u2022 Relatively common cause of colitis in Boxer breeds and infrequently seen in French bulldogs and border collies. \u2022 Boxer colitis is also referred to as granulomatous colitis (GC) in light of the granulomatous inflammation (macrophages) in the colon. \u2022 Etiology of GC is an adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strain. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs\u2014primarily affects young Boxers, usually <3 years of age. \u2022 Reported in French bulldogs and border collies less frequently. SIGNS \u2022 Bloody, mucoid diarrhea with marked increase in frequency of defecation. \u2022 Tenesmus. \u2022 Weight loss and anorexia can occur and debilitation may develop. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS GC appears to be a genetic disorder in boxer breeds associated with reduced macrophage phagocytic function and inability to kill AIEC.", "Compulsive Disorders\u2014Cats": " \u2022 Compulsive disorders are relatively invariant exaggerated behavior patterns, often derived from normal behaviors but out of context and repetitive, without apparent function; may be performed to the exclusion of other normal behaviors or to the detriment of the animal. \u2022 May be a heterogeneous group of conditions with differing pathologies including compulsive, stereotypic, and neurologic; therefore abnormal repetitive behaviors might be used to describe the clinical presentation. \u2022 Considered here are psychogenic dermatitis/alopecia, compulsive fabric chewing/sucking, and hyperesthesia syndrome. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Diagnosis of exclusion; must rule out pathophysiologic causes, including psychomotor seizures, before a presumptive diagnosis is made. \u2022 Can be a behavioral response to confinement, specific anxietyproducing event, or undefined environmental conditions (e.g., conflict, stress, anxiety, frustration); over time, can become fixed and independent of the environment; affected cats may lack control of onset or termination. \u2022 Behaviors may be self-reinforcing\u2014allowing some animals to cope with conditions that do not meet their species-specific needs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014fabric chewing/sucking. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014feline hyperesthesia (involves cutaneous trunci muscle), tail attack/mutilation. \u2022 Skin/ exocrine\u2014psychogenic dermatitis/alopecia. \u2022 Nervous\u2014feline hyperesthesia syndrome. GENETICS None identified, although the association of compulsive fabric chewing/sucking with Asian breeds suggests a heritable component. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Unknown, uncommon. SIGNALMENT Species Cat Breed Predispositions Siamese, Burmese, Birman, and crosses may be overrepresented for fabric chewing and sucking. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Compulsive disorders can develop at any time, generally not seen in kittens. \u2022 Psychogenic dermatitis/alopecia\u20146 months to 12 years. \u2022 Fabric chewing/sucking\u201412\u201349 months; generally around 24 months. \u2022 Hyper - esthesia syndrome\u20141\u20135 years. Predominant Sex None SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Behaviors may quickly increase in frequency if reinforced with attention by owner. \u2022 Scolding or punishment may increase cat anxiety and stress and worsen expression of behavior. Historical Findings \u2022 Onset may be coincident with environmental change (e.g., move or new household member) suggesting stress effect; cat may hide to avoid punishment. \u2022 Psychogenic dermatitis/ alopecia\u2014may be associated with excessive grooming to exclusion of other activities; may be history of flea exposure or diet change. \u2022 Compulsive fabric chewing/sucking\u2014some patients show preference for specific fabric type such as wool or may have general texture preference; grind fabric with molars; may ingest fabric leading to foreign body obstruction. \u2022 Hyperesthesia syndrome\u2014 may be triggered by tactile contact (petting along dorsum and rump); may be episodic; flea exposure. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Psychogenic dermatitis/alopecia\u2014focal, partial, and bilateral dermatitis or alopecia; most common locations: groin, ventrum, and medial or caudal thigh regions; appearance of skin variable (normal or abnormal; erythe matous to abraded). \u2022 Fabric chewing/sucking\u2014 often normal; secondary gastrointestinal inflammation or obstruction may occur if cat ingests material. \u2022 Hyperesthesia syndrome\u2014 episode may be prompted by petting or scratching dorsum; signs may include dilated pupils, salivation, alarming vocalization, \u201crippling skin\u201d (hyperresponsive cutaneous trunci muscle), inappropriate urination or defecation, tail twitching, frantic grooming, self-directed (especially to tail) or ownerdirected aggression, escape behavior. CAUSES Unidentified RISK FACTORS \u2022 Changes in environment might predispose cat to compulsive disorder. \u2022 More commonly reported in indoor cats. \u2022 Cats fed ad libitum may have lower prevalence of fabric chewing/ sucking; must be balanced with nutritional needs.", "Compulsive Disorders\u2014Dogs": " \u2022 Heterogeneous group of abnormal repetitive behaviors with differing pathologies (compulsive, stereotypic, neurologic). \u2022 Categorized as locomotor (spinning, tail chasing, circling, fence running, pacing, light/shadow chasing); oral (licking, sucking/mouthing an object/ body part, e.g., flank, tail, limb; pica, excessive drinking, \u201cfly biting\u201d); or hallucinatory (\u201cfly biting,\u201d hind end checking, freezing, staring), with/without vocal and affective responses. \u2022 Compulsive disorders (CDs) are abnormal, repetitive, exaggerated, and/or sustained, variable in form and fixated on a goal; they are derived from normal maintenance behaviors (e.g., grooming, predation, ingestion); motivational conflict or frustration appears to trigger the behaviors in specific contexts often associated with high arousal; with repeated/ sustained conflict, the behavior becomes emancipated from the original trigger(s) and displayed in diverse contexts; the animal may lack control of onset or termination. \u2022 Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors that are unvaried in sequence and have no obvious function or purpose; they may arise in situations of conflict/frustration related to confinement or husbandry practices, when the environment lacks sufficient outlets for the normal behavior repertoire, and with maternal deprivation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Alterations in brain neurotransmitter functions likely\u2014primarily serotonin; also dopamine, glutamate, endorphins; different CDs may preferentially involve different brain regions. \u2022 Abnormal serotonin transmission has been identified as a primary mechanism by which compulsive disorders are induced; stereotypies might be induced by dopaminergic stimulation.

Predominant Sex Some CDs may be more common in males. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Wide variety of manifestations\u2014behaviors may be repetitive or static (e.g., freezing). \u2022 Signs may not be observed during exam - ination; descriptions may be unclear; video aids diagnosis and treatment planning. Historical Findings \u2022 May be other signs of anxiety/concurrent behavioral diagnoses (e.g., separation anxiety, fears, aggression) and/or a history of stress (e.g., inadequate stimulation, punishment, change in routine/household). \u2022 Behavior may first be displayed as play or in situations of high arousal/stress; eventually may occur in multiple contexts independent of identifiable triggers. \u2022 Certain repetitive behaviors are expressed in situations with little to no external stimulation or evidence of arousal (e.g., blanket sucking). \u2022 May occur whether or not the owner is present; if punished, pet may avoid detection. \u2022 Hallmarks\u2014behavior is ritualized, often exaggerated in form, and with time increases in frequency, intensity, and duration. \u2022 Behavior may be difficult/ impossible to interrupt. \u2022 Behavior may interfere with normal functioning (e.g., eating, sleeping, social interactions). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May be unremarkable. \u2022 May see skin lesions/injuries related to self-trauma (especially tail, forelimbs, distal extremities); excessive tooth wear/damage; lameness or poor body condition.

Mean Age and Range Not applicable Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Appear 7\u201314 days after contact with raccoon saliva (bite or scratch), receipt of vaccination, or development of respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. \u2022 Initial signs\u2014 stiff, stilted gait in all limbs, typically starting in the pelvic limbs and eventually progressing to the thoracic limbs. \u2022 Rapid progression (2\u20134 days) to a flaccid, lower motor neuron tetraparesis to tetraplegia. \u2022 Owners may notice loss or change of voice. \u2022 Appetite and water consumption\u2014usually normal. \u2022 Urination and defecation\u2014normal. \u2022 Progressive phase of the disease\u2014clinical signs can continue to worsen up to 5\u201310 days after onset. Neurologic Examination Findings \u2022 Usually symmetric. \u2022 Stiff, stilted gait that usually progresses rapidly to lower motor neuron tetraparesis or tetraplegia; some dogs may remain ambulatory tetraparetic. \u2022 Generalized hyporeflexia to areflexia, with the exception of a normal perineal reflex. \u2022 Generalized hypotonia to atonia, severe neurogenic muscle atrophy. \u2022 Affected dogs often show inability to hold the head up. \u2022 Aphonia or dysphonia common; no megaesophagus. \u2022 Facial paresis\u2014bilateral incomplete palpebral closure in some patients. \u2022 Respiration\u2014labored in severely affected dogs; occasional progression to respiratory paralysis. \u2022 Pain sensation intact; hyperesthesia common\u2014may reflect variable dorsal nerve root inflammation. \u2022 Motor dysfunction\u2014always predominates; even tetraplegic patient can usually wag its tail. \u2022 Mental status, urination, and defecation\u2014 unaffected. CAUSES \u2022 CHP\u2014contact with a raccoon; perhaps more important, contact with raccoon saliva. \u2022 ACIP\u2014none proven; possibly previous respiratory or gastrointestinal viral or bacterial infection. \u2022 Postvaccinal polyradiculoneuritis\u2014 recent vaccination (rare). RISK FACTORS \u2022 CHP\u2014coonhounds tend to be predisposed primarily because of the nature of their activities; previous disease does not confer immunity and may increase risk of redevelopment; multiple bouts not uncommon. \u2022 ACIP\u2014unknown.", "Copper Associated Hepatopathy": " \u2022 Severe hepatic accumulation of copper (Cu) causes acute or chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis or death from liver failure. \u2022 Mild to moderate hepatic Cu accumulation augments oxidative injury and increases risk for liver disease caused by other hepatobiliary insults, notably hepatotoxicity from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \u2022 Primary copper associated hepatopathy (CuAH) depicts copper accumulation in the absence of other liver disorders or as the major cause of liver injury . \u2022 Secondary CuAH depicts Cu accumulation caused by severe chronic cholestasis in cats (not dogs) or fulminant hepatic failure (rare). \u2022 Genetic primary CuAH \u2014only proven in Bedlington terriers. \u2022 Acquired primary CuAH \u2014most common canine cause of CuAH, reflects dietary Cu availability in commercial dog food that exceeds individual\u2019s tolerance limit. \u2022 Congenital primary CuAH (no gene mutation characterized)\u2014comparatively rare in cats. \u2022 Some animals with primary CuAH accumulate Cu without histologic evidence of liver damage despite vacillating liver enzyme activity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] most common); in absence of inflammation or hepatocyte necrosis, the term hepatopathy is most correct. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hepatic Cu homeostasis involves complex regulatory system including protein transporters, chaperones, membrane receptors, intracellular binding proteins, canalicular egress pumps; Cu absorbed from small intestine, stored in liver, with excess excreted in bile. \u2022 A single gene mutation ( COMMD1 ) causes genetic primary CuAH in Bedlington terriers. \u2022 More commonly, canine hepatic Cu accumulation reflects Cu intake exceeding capacity to maintain neutral Cu balance; suspected pharmacogenetic basis. \u2022 Secondary CuAH reflects reduced canalicular Cu egress associated with severe cholestasis (cats only) or severe panlobular liver injury (fulminant hepatic failure, rare). \u2022 Primary CuAH\u2014hepatocyte cytosolic Cu first accumulates in zone 3 (centrilobular region). \u2022 Secondary CuAH (cats)\u2014hepatocyte cytosolic Cu accumulates in zone 1 (periportal) or adjacent to injured regions. \u2022 Hepatic Cu concentrations widely variable\u2014 primary CuAH: range 500 to > 10,000 \u03bc g/g dry weight liver (DWL); secondary CuAH in cats rarely exceeds 1,000 \u03bc g/g DWL. \u2022 Cu accumulation causes oxidative membrane injury\u2014cell and organelles; high hepatic Cu concentration not always associated with histologic evidence of liver injury. \u2022 Focal hepatitis initiated by Cu may progress to chronic hepatitis, eventually cirrhosis. \u2022 Rarely, acute severe hepatic necrosis releases Cu into systemic circulation causing hemolysis and/or acute-onset acquired Fanconi syndrome (proximal renal tubular injury causing euglycemic glucosuria). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014centrilobular hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, eventual cirrhosis. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic\u2014hemolytic anemia rare sequel to acute hepatic necrosis in dogs. \u2022 Renal\u2014rare reversible Fanconi syndrome causes euglycemic glycosuria, granular casts, \u00b1 clinicopathologic evidence of compromised renal function. GENETICS \u2022 Autosomal recessive COMMD1 mutation in Bedlington terriers reduces biliary Cu excretion. \u2022 Gene mutations remain unproven in other breeds and in cats; gene associations may modify susceptibility in Labrador retrievers, but no genetic test and liver biopsy remains gold standard for diagnosis of CuAH. \u2022 Predisposition to CuAH recognized in Labrador retriever, West Highland white terrier, Doberman pinscher, Dalmatian, keeshond, corgi, Staffordshire terrier, and other breeds. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Bedlington terrier\u2014at one time up to 2/3 of dogs carried COMMD1 mutation; incidence significantly declined with genetic testing. \u2022 Prevalence of excess hepatic Cu remains high in West Highland white terrier, Labrador retriever, Doberman pinscher, and other breeds. \u2022 CuAH currently most common cause of chronically increased ALT activity in dogs (since mid-1990s) likely caused by increased Cu availability in manufactured dog foods. \u2022 CuAH comprises \u226520% of liver biopsy submissions for abnormal enzyme activity in dogs. \u2022 Primary congenital CuAH occurs in cats but comparatively rare. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Reported worldwide. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat; more common in dog. Breed Predilections Bedlington terrier, West Highland white terrier, Labrador retriever, Doberman pinscher, Dalmatian, Welsh corgi, keeshond, Staffordshire terrier with observed increased incidence of high hepatic Cu concentrations; no canine breed exempt. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Bedlington terrier\u2014Cu slowly accumulates to max at \u223c 6 years of age; dogs can be clinically affected at any age; most present as middle-aged to older dogs with chronic hepatitis. \u2022 West Highland white terrier\u2014maximum Cu accumulation observed by 12 months of age and may vacillate or decline with clinical disease at any time; however , some dogs with high hepatic Cu survive to old age (15 years) without evidence of liver injury. \u2022 Labrador retriever, Doberman pinscher, Dalmatian, other breeds\u2014young adult to middle-aged at diagnosis for chronic hepatitis. \u2022 Doberman pinscher\u2014often develop hepatitis with ALT increases and Cu accumulation at 1\u20133 years of age; clinical signs of liver disease often recognized by 5\u20137 years of age. Predominant Sex None SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Primary CuAH\u20144 categories: \u25e6 no clinical signs; \u25e6 subclinical disease: increased ALT activity with no clinical illness; \u25e6 acute disease associated with severe acute hepatic necrosis; \u25e6 chronic progressive hepatitis eventually evolving cirrhosis. \u2022 Secondary CuAH accompanies feline cholestatic necroinflammatory liver disease (cholangiohepatitis) or rarely in dogs with fulminant liver necrosis. \u2022 Acute signs\u2014with extreme hepatic Cu accumulation, sudden-onset lethargy, anorexia, vomiting; may have rapid course, dogs succumb despite intensive supportive care. \u2022 Chronic signs\u2014variable, intermittent lethargy, hyporexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, with later polydipsia and polyuria; eventual liver injury leads to ascites, jaundice, bleeding tendencies, hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Acute signs\u2014lethargy, weakness, jaundice, pallor (anemia), vomiting, diarrhea, dark urine (bilirubinuria); rare hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria if intravascular Cu-mediated hemolysis. \u2022 Chronic signs\u2014weight loss, ascites, jaundice, nodular microhepatia; melena and petechial hemorrhage in animals with significant panlobular injury. CAUSES \u2022 Genetic primary CuAH\u2014single gene mutation in Bedlington terriers. \u2022 Acquired primary CuAH\u2014either Bedlington mutation or suspected pharmacogenetic differences involving regulatory pathways influencing Cu homeostasis, making them intolerant to current levels of dietary Cu supplementation. \u2022 Secondary acquired CuAH\u2014necroinflamm - atory chronic cholestatic liver disease in cats or diffuse severe panlobular injury in dogs or cats (rare). RISK FACTORS \u2022 Primary\u2014feeding diets or providing water with Cu concentrations exceeding individual\u2019s tolerance to maintain neutral Cu balance. \u2022 Stress or concurrent illnesses may precipitate acute illness in dogs with hepatocyte Cu accumulation. \u2022 Asymptomatic dogs with primary CuAH may become symptomatic when additional disease processes or toxicities (e.g., NSAID administration; CCNU chemotherapy) impose oxidative challenge, expose hepatocytes to inflammatory cytokines, or another primary liver disease develops.", "Coprophagia and Pica": " Pica is an abnormal ingestive behavior in which nonfood items are consumed. Coprophagia is a form of pica in which feces is consumed. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The pathophysiology of pica is unclear. \u2022 Coprophagia is not usually a pathologic condition. \u2022 Pica is a sign that may be associated with a variety of different conditions\u2014any medical condition leading to nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, polyphagia, or CNS disturbances may lead to pica and/or coprophagia. \u2022 Severely calorierestricted diets or imbalanced diets leading to insufficiencies may also lead to pica and/or coprophagia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED GI\u2014foreign body obstruction, GI upset leading to vomiting and diarrhea; increased chance of GI parasitism with coprophagia. GENETICS None known. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Pica\u2014unknown. \u2022 Coprophagia\u2014occurrence has been estimated at 16\u201323% in dogs. SIGNALMENT Species Coprophagia is common in dogs but rare in cats. Pica is seen in both dogs and cats. Breed Predilections Oriental cat breeds such as Siamese may be at greater risk of pica. Mean Age and Range Pica occurs more often in puppies than in adult dogs. Pica in cats is most likely to begin prior to 18 months of age. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 In dogs, ingestion of inappropriate items such as rocks, clothing, and/or feces. \u2022 In cats, ingestion of fabrics, plastic, shoelaces, string, thread, or other inappropriate items. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Halitosis if coprophagia is the presenting problem. \u2022 Dental trauma if the dog targets hard objects. \u2022 Pallor or weakness if anemia is a contributing condition. \u2022 Poor body condition if malabsorption or maldigestion is a contributing condition. \u2022 Neurologic signs if caused by neurologic disease. \u2022 May be abnormalities on abdominal palpation if gastroenteritis or foreign body. CAUSES Behavioral Causes \u2022 Coprophagia is considered normal maternal behavior; the dam or queen licks the anogenital region of the neonate to stimulate elimination and then consumes the excreta. \u2022 Coprophagia may be considered a normal exploratory behavior in puppies; it has been postulated that high levels of deoxycholic acid in feces may contribute to neurologic development. \u2022 It is normal for dogs to seek out cat feces because it is high in protein\u2014odor and taste may also be appealing. \u2022 Ungulate feces is also appealing to dogs, apparently due to partially digested vegetable matter. \u2022 Dogs described as \u201cgreedy eaters\u201d have higher incidence of coprophagy; therefore a voracious appetite may predispose to coprophagia. \u2022 Feces may be appetizing to some dogs, so the behavior might be self\u00adrewarding. \u2022 Dogs that have been punished for eliminating in the house could learn to eat their own feces in an apparent attempt to avoid punishment. \u2022 Dogs may also eat their own feces as a form of \u201cnest cleaning.\u201d \u2022 Coprophagia may be attention\u00adseeking behavior if a dog learns that it reliably leads to immediate owner attention. \u2022 Coprophagia may also develop in response to anxiety or frustration. \u2022 Pica may occur secondary to stealing behavior when the dog is highly motivated to prevent the owner from retrieving the stolen object or when the object has ingestive appeal. \u2022 Pica may develop as a result of anxiety or frustration that leads to destruction and subsequent consumption of an item. Medical Causes \u2022 Anemia. \u2022 Malnutrition leading to poly \u00ad phagia. \u2022 Endocrinopathies\u2014hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism. \u2022 Maldigestion/malabsorption (e.g., exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). \u2022 Inflammatory bowel disease. \u2022 Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. \u2022 CNS disease. \u2022 Portosystemic shunt. \u2022 Intestinal parasitism. Drug-Induced Causes Administration of drugs such as corticosteroids, progestins, phenobarbital, or benzodiazepines can lead to polyphagia. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Early weaning of kittens has been postulated to lead to sucking and ingestion of fabrics. \u2022 Cats fed low\u00adroughage diets and/or not allowed access to roughage sources such as grass. \u2022 Dogs lacking appropriately stimulating environment, adequate activity, or social interactions may be at risk for pica and/or coprophagia. \u2022 Long periods of confinement, especially in a barren environment, may predispose to coprophagia. \u2022 Dogs in multidog households may be at higher risk of demonstrating coprophagia.", "Corneal and Scleral Lacerations": " \u2022 Penetrating\u2014a wound or foreign body enters but does not pass through the cornea or sclera. \u2022 Perforating\u2014a wound or foreign body completely passes through the cornea or sclera; greater risk of vision loss than penetrating. \u2022 Simple\u2014only the cornea or sclera, penetrating or perforating, other eye structures intact. \u2022 Complicated\u2014perforating, involves other ocular structures, uveal, vitreal, or retinal incarceration or prolapse through the wound, traumatic cataract, hyphema, lid lacerations.

Coughing can happen voluntarily as well as involuntarily, although in dogs and cats it is presumed to be essentially involuntary. Coughing should not be confused with other airway sounds (cf differential diagnosis). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 A physiologic reflex in healthy animals that protects the lower airways from inhalation of foreign particles and helps clear particles that have been entrapped in the mucus; acts in conjunction with the mucociliary clearance mechanism. \u2022 The cough pathway includes cough receptors, which are made up of sensory nerves in the airways, the vagus nerve, the central cough center, and effector muscles. \u2022 The cough pathway can be stimulated by mechanical or chemical factors; endogenous triggers include airway secretions and inflammation; exogenous triggers include smoke and aspirated foreign material. \u2022 Cough receptors include rapidly adapting stretch receptors (sensitive to mechanical stimuli) that are located within the mucosa of the tracheobronchial tree (especially larynx and trachea), and pulmonary/bronchial C-fibers, which are more sensitive to chemical stimulation; coughing mechanisms and pathways are very complex and are not fully understood, even in humans. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014cough of any origin can be an inciting factor for aggravation or precipitation of signs associated with tracheal collapse in susceptible breeds. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014 enlargement or impaired function of the right ventricle can result from a respiratory disorder causing tissue damage, hypoxic injury, and/or chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (cor pulmonale). SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs and cats of all ages and breeds. \u2022 Much more common clinical sign in dogs than in cats. \u2022 Cough of tracheal origin is less common in cats than in dogs. \u2022 Age, breed, and sex predispositions vary with inciting cause. SIGNS \u2022 Cough must be differentiated from similar signs such as reverse sneezing, gagging, retching. \u2022 Description of the cough and/or smartphone recording of suspect sounds are helpful in identification of the anatomic structures involved in dogs (i.e., honking cough is typical of tracheal collapse, harsh sonorous cough followed by terminal retch characterizes cough of tracheal or bronchial origin, faint moist cough is heard in moderate to severe pneumonia). \u2022 Cough can be described as dry or moist, productive, honking, short or harsh, faint or sonorous, followed by gagging or retching. \u2022 Cough can be elicited by traction on the collar (laryngeal or tracheal origin), aggravated by exercise or excitation (tracheal collapse), or can occur after a period of rest (cough due to heart failure). \u2022 Can be accompanied by stertor or stridor (laryngeal, tracheal origin) or dyspnea (many areas). CAUSES Upper Respiratory Tract Diseases \u2022 A variety of sinonasal conditions cause extension of inflammation and/or secretions into the pharynx and/or larynx and can lead to the upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome. \u2022 Laryngeal and/or pharyngeal disease (inflammation, paralysis, tumor, granuloma, collapse). \u2022 Tracheal disease (inflammation, infection, foreign body, collapse, stenosis, tumor).

This finding may be normal, clinically significant or artifactual. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Identification of crystals formed in vitro does not justify therapy. \u2022 Crystals form only in urine that is, or recently has been, supersaturated with crystallogenic substances; thus in vivo crystalluria represents risk factor for urolithiasis. \u2022 Certain crystal types such as cystine, urate, or 2,8-dihydroxyadenine may indicate underlying disease; proper identification and interpretation of urine crystals important in formulation of medical protocols to dissolve uroliths. \u2022 Crystalluria in individuals with anatomically and functionally normal urinary tracts usually harmless because crystals eliminated before they grow large enough to interfere with normal urinary function; however, they represent a risk factor for urolithiasis. \u2022 Crystals that form following elimination or removal of urine from the patient often are of little clinical importance; in recent studies following time and temperature changes, crystals formed in 28% of dog and cat samples that were initially free of crystals. \u2022 Detection of some types of crystals (e.g., cystine and ammonium urate) in clinically asymptomatic patients or detection of any form of crystals in fresh urine collected from patients with confirmed urolithiasis may have diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic importance. \u2022 Drug crystals detected in patients administered high doses of medications such as allopurinol, sulfadiazines, or fluoroquinolones should prompt therapy changes due to risk for formation of drug-containing uroliths. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Renal/urologic/hepatic. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Calcium oxalate in miniature schnauzer, bichon fris\u00e9, Yorkshire terrier, Lhasa apso, miniature poodle dogs; Burmese, Himalayan, Persian cats. \u2022 Cystine in dachshunds, English bulldogs, Newfoundlands, and others. \u2022 Ammonium urate in Dalmatians and English bulldogs. \u2022 Struvite in any dog with concomitant urinary tract infection (UTI). \u2022 Struvite in cats not typically associated with UTIs. \u2022 Xanthine in cavalier King Charles spaniels. \u2022 2,8-dihydroxyadenine in North American indigenous dogs and wolves. SIGNS None, or those caused by concomitant urolithiasis. CAUSES In Vivo Variables \u2022 Concentration of crystallogenic substances in urine (in turn influenced by rate of excretion and urine concentration). \u2022 Urine pH (struvite and calcium phosphate most common in neutral-to-alkaline urine; ammonium urate, sodium urate, calcium oxalate, cystine, and xanthine crystals most common in acid-to-neutral urine). \u2022 Solubility of crystallogenic substances in urine. \u2022 Excretion of diagnostic agents (e.g., radio - paque contrast agents) and medications (e.g., sulfonamides). \u2022 Dietary influence\u2014hospital diet may differ from home diet; timing of sample collection (fasting vs. postprandial) may influence evidence of crystalluria. In Vitro Variables \u2022 Temperature. \u2022 Evaporation. \u2022 pH changes following sample collection. \u2022 Technique of specimen preparation\u2014 centrifugation versus noncentrifugation, volume of urine examined. \u2022 Important in vitro changes that occur following urine collection may enhance formation or dissolution of crystals; when knowledge of in vivo urine crystal type and quantity especially important, examine fresh specimens, ideally at body temperature; if not possible, they should be at room temperature, not refrigeration temperature. \u2022 Collection container\u2014spurious crystals may be contaminants from unclean collection containers.

Adult flies lay eggs on blades of grass or in nests; they hatch and crawl onto the skin of passing host. The small maggots enter a body orifice, migrate through various internal tissues, and ultimately over several weeks to months make their way to the skin, where they establish a warble. The mature maggots, which may be an inch long, then drop out of the rodent or rabbit host and pupate in the soil. \u2022 Dogs and cats become infected when they contact a blade of grass upon which an egg containing an infective maggot is stimulated to hatch and attach onto the passing animal. The maggots then crawl around on the cat or dog until they find an orifice in which to enter. \u2022 Dogs and cats can develop maggots in warbles or can develop signs associated with larvae migrating within their tissues. \u2022 Dogs and cats can present with respiratory signs, neurologic signs, ophthalmic lesions, or maggots in their skin.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Sensorineural Deafness \u2022 Hereditary\u2014breed-related cochlear degeneration closely associated with the recessive alleles of the piebald locus and the dominant allele of the merle locus in dogs and with the dominant allele of the white locus in cats. These genes alter the ability of neural crest melanocytes to populate regions of the body including skin, hair, iris, ocular tapetum, and portions of the cochlea. The absence of melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the cochlea is associated with early postnatal degeneration of this structure.

Aggressive public education and preventive measures have resulted in a decline in incidence over the past several decades. \u2022 In humans, Streptococcus mutans is particularly implicated in the development of caries. \u2022 For various reasons (e.g., diet lower in refined carbohydrates, higher salivary pH, lower salivary amylase, conical crown shape, wider interdental spacing, different indigenous oral flora), caries is not common in the domestic dog, but it does occur and should be looked for. \u2022 A study published in the Journal of Veterinary Dentistry in 1998 (see Suggested Reading) reported that 5.3% of dogs 1 year of age or older had one or more caries lesions, with 52% having bilaterally symmetric lesions. \u2022 Caries can affect the crown or roots of the teeth and is classified as pit-and-fissure, smooth-surface, or root caries. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Caries occurs in dogs. \u2022 Reported in cats; tooth resorption (feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions [FORL]) has sometimes been misnamed feline caries. To the author\u2019s knowledge, there are no published reports of true dental caries occurring in the domestic cat, though it is theoretically possible. \u2022 There is no reported breed, age, or gender predilection. \u2022 Anecdotally, the author has observed a higher incidence of pit-and-fissure lesions in the occlusal tables of the maxillary first molar teeth in large-breed dogs such as Labrador retrievers and German shepherds. SIGNS \u2022 Incipient smooth-surface caries\u2014appears as an area of dull, frosty-white enamel. \u2022 Clinical caries\u2014appears as a structural defect on the surface of the crown or root. \u2022 The defect is frequently filled with or lined by dark, soft necrotic dentin. The defect may also trap and hold food debris. \u2022 Affected dentin will yield to a dental explorer and can be removed with a dental excavator or curette. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Caries is caused by oral bacteria fermenting carbohydrates on the tooth surface, leading to the production of acids (acetic, lactic, propionic) that demineralize the enamel, cementum, and dentin, followed by digestion of the organic matrix of the tooth by oral bacteria and/or leukocytes. \u2022 There is a constant exchange of minerals between the tooth surfaces (enamel, any exposed dentin or root cementum) and the oral fluids; if there is a net loss of mineral, caries develops. \u2022 Early (incipient) caries may be reversible through remineralization. \u2022 Once the protein matrix collapses, the lesion is irreversible. \u2022 Any factors that allow prolonged retention of fermentable carbohydrates and bacterial plaque on the tooth surface predispose to the development of caries. \u2022 A deep occlusal pit on the maxillary first molar is the most common place for caries to develop. \u2022 Dental surfaces in close contact with an established caries are at risk of developing a lesion by extension. \u2022 Deep occlusal pits and developmental grooves on the crown surface predispose to pit-and-fissure caries. \u2022 Tight interdental contacts predispose to smooth-surface caries. \u2022 Deep periodontal pockets predispose to root caries. \u2022 Animals with poorly mineralized enamel, lower salivary pH, diets high in fermentable carbohydrates, and poor oral hygiene are at risk of developing caries. \u2022 Loss of enamel through any means (hypo - calcification at the developmental stage, abrasive wear or attrition, traumatic fracture) that exposes the softer, underlying dentin may increase the risk for the development of caries.", "Dentigerous Cyst": " Cyst formation originating from tissue surrounding the crown of an unerupted tooth.

Unlike diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ketone production and metabolic acidosis are not major features of HHS. \u2022 Specific guidelines for HHS diagnosis are lacking in dogs and cats, but serum effective osmolarity >320 mOsm/L, glucose concentration >600 mg/dL, and bicarbonate concentration >18 mEq/L, along with minimal ketonuria, are criteria in humans. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hyperglycemia is due to insulin deficiency from DM; insulinopenia reduces tissue glucose utilization and increases hepatic glucose production, leading to increased extracellular glucose concentrations; the magnitude of hyperglycemia in HHS is usually greater than in DKA. \u2022 Hyperosmolarity develops secondary to hyperglycemia and is exacerbated by dehydration and reduced extracellular fluid volume; the contribution of glucose to total plasma osmolarity is significant in HHS. \u2022 Dehydration and volume deficit are typically severe and are caused by several factors, including reduced water intake and volume losses via gastrointestinal and renal systems. \u2022 Reduced plasma volume decreases glomerular filtration rate and urine production, leading to azotemia; in HHS, severe volume contraction with reduced urinary glucose excretion results in severe hyperglycemia and plasma hyperosmolarity. \u2022 Hyperketonemia and ketonuria are not major features of HHS; lactic acidosis secondary to volume depletion, tissue hypoperfusion, and impaired glucose metabolism is the major cause of acidosis in patients with HHS.

Internal/External Resorption \u2022 Internal\u2014follows pulpal injury (trauma) causing vascular changes with increased oxygen tension and decreased pH, resulting in destruction (resorption) of the tooth from within the pulp from odontoclasts; tooth has pinkish hue. \u2022 External\u2014many factors possible: trauma, orthodontic treatment, excessive occlusal forces, periodontal disease (and treatment), tumors, periapical inflammation, and unknown factors; resorption can start anywhere along the periodontal ligament and can extend to the pulp and into the crown causing a pinkish discoloration; osteoclasts and odontoclasts resorb the tooth structure. Medications and Discoloration \u2022 Tetracycline\u2014during enamel formation, it binds to calcium, forming a calcium orthophosphate complex in the collagen matrix of enamel; occurs on multiple teeth; results in a yellow-brown discoloration.

It results in widespread formation of microthrombi with clinical manifestations of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage. Non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is the early, compensated form of DIC that features consumption of coagulation factors and generation of microthrombi without clear clinical signs. Overt (decompensated) DIC refers to the classic phenotype associated with hemorrhage, thrombosis, and organ failure. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 DIC represents a complication of a variety of primary conditions. It begins with a hypercoagulable state that leads to production or embolization of microthrombi in small vessels. \u2022 The primary conditions act through increased exposure/production of tissue factor (TF) that activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway. \u2022 TF is normally restricted from intravascular exposure. Increased TF exposure occurs through widespread endothelial injury and/or inflammation. \u2022 Inflammation activates endothelial cells, platelets, and monocytes leading to membrane expression of TF. Inflammatory cytokines also induce vesiculation of these membranes, releasing large quantities of microparticles into circulation that are enriched with both TF and phosphatidylserine (PS) and facilitate initiation of coagulation. Some neoplastic cells constitutively produce membrane TF and also release microparticles. \u2022 Microparticles provide a suitable membrane surface for amplifying intrinsic and common pathway coagulation, potentially leading to uncontrolled production of thrombin that overwhelms endogenous coagulation inhibitors. Fibrin clots generated by thrombin can cause vascular occlusion and lead to organ dysfunction. \u2022 Widespread microthrombus formation consumes coagulation factors and platelets while initiating fibrinolysis. By-products of fibrinolysis (fibrin degradation products [FDPs]) have anticoagulant properties and inhibit platelet function. Hemorrhage at a variety of sites can follow. \u2022 Uncontrolled progression leads to widespread tissue hypoxia, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Multisystemic syndrome.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Greater risk near bodies of water (including pools, buckets, bathtubs) or ice. \u2022 Owner negligence or inadequate safety precautions vs. purposeful harm. \u2022 Animals in or near water at time of seizure, head trauma, hypoglycemic event, cardiac arrhythmia, or syncopal episode are at risk of drowning.", "Ductal Plate Malformation (Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis)": " \u2022 Ductal plate malformations (DPMs) are congenital noninflammatory hepatopathies subject to complicating bacterial cholangitis; recognized most often in juvenile and young adult dogs or cats and reflect malformation of biliary structures. \u2022 DPMs reflect aberrant development, differentiation, proliferation, or intussusceptive resorption of embryonic anlage of bile ducts during development of ductal plate, embryologic precursor of portal tract structures (predominantly bile ducts). \u2022 Pathomechanisms leading to DPM interfere with tubulogenesis\u2014may affect kidneys, liver, or pancreatic ductal structures. \u2022 Four DPM phenotypes defined based on involved structures and severity of coexistent portal tract fibrosis, severity of fibroductal bridging trabeculae, development of presinusoidal portal hypertension (PH) causing splanchnic hypertension, and development of acquired portosystemic shunts (APSS). \u2022 Animals with DPM have propensity for septic suppurative cholangitis, choledochitis, cholelithiasis, or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO). MAJOR DPM PHENOTYPES \u2022 Choledochal cyst \u2014diverticulum protruding from common bile duct (CBD) or cystic duct; propensity for infection similar to appendicitis in humans; may cause systemic sepsis, EHBDO, and cranial abdominal mass effect; complex confusing US appearance. \u2022 Caroli\u2019s malformation \u2014irregular duct silhouettes (sacculation, invagination, or \u201cbudding\u201d protrusions) with occasional periductal satellite ductal elements surrounding large ducts; malformations variably involve hepatic, interlobular, or large intralobular bile ducts; biliary epithelium may appear normal, hyperplastic, attenuated, or vacuolated; intraluminal debris in large ducts; develop choleliths, dystrophic mineralization, septic cholangitis. \u2022 Small proliferative-like phenotype \u2014diffuse intralobular bile duct malformation without or with bridging portal-to-portal fibroductular trabeculae: if fibrosis severe may evolve presinusoidal PH and consequent splanchnic hypertension = congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) phenotype \u2014 involves small intralobular bile duct malformation with densely packed proliferative-like ductule structures (\u00b1 luminal apertures) within excessive extracellular matrix (ECM); ECM accrual varies in severity, but appears progressive with aging; histologic features characterized by amalgamation of proliferative bile ductules with numerous stout (muscular) entangling arterials and inconspicuous portal veins within exuberant ECM that dimensionally expands portal tracts; variable fibroductal bridging partitions may interconnect portal regions; because ECM accrues with aging, transformation to CHF may occur over time. \u2022 von Meyenburg\u2019s complexes (VMCs) \u2014isolated single microscopic DPM composed of clustered proliferative intralobular bile duct profiles embedded in expanded ECM; also termed bile duct hamartomas; usually located adjacent to liver capsule; inconsequential malformation. \u2022 Progression of portal tract fibrosis with aging can lead to gradual onset of presinusoidal PH, formation of APSS, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). \u2022 Gallbladder (GB) agenesis and severe hypo plasia or agenesis of entire liver lobes may occur. \u2022 Liver lobes may be variably affected with DPM; unaffected liver lobes possible. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 DPMs not associated with increased liver enzymes or jaundice unless complicated by infection, choleliths, EHBDO, or choledochitis. \u2022 Different phenotypes acquire different disease manifestations. \u2022 Choledochal cysts\u2014 not recognized until cystic luminal contents contaminated by bacteria with ensuing infection and cyst expansion, development of choledochitis or EHBDO; until compromised CBD patency patient remains anicteric, usually asymptomatic. \u2022 Caroli\u2019s malformation\u2014 serendipitously recognized on abdominal radiography (limy gallbladder, mineralized sacculated intrahepatic large bile ducts), or on abdominal US as distended intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts, mineralized ducts, association with cholelithiasis, or thickened duct walls (infection, choledochitis). \u2022 Diffuse DPM without extensive bridging fibrosis or presinusoidal PH \u2014not associated with increased liver enzymes or jaundice, usually normal total serum bile acid (TSBA) concentrations; diagnosed when infection increases liver enzyme activity leading to liver biopsy. \u2022 Diffuse DPM with bridging fibrosis (CHF) causes presinusoidal PH \u2014these patients may present for ascites, increased TSBA concentrations, \u00b1 increased liver enzymes reflecting secondary cholangitis, or for HE; not jaundiced unless infected or have concurrent EHBDO. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Liver\u2014variable size (small, normal, large); may have GB agenesis or maldevelopment of entire liver lobe(s); rare concurrent congenital intrahepatic or extrahepatic congenital portosystemic vascular anomaly (shunt, PSVA); jaundice due to EHBDO from choledochal cyst, cholelithiasis, rare cholangio - carcinoma, or due to sepsis (Caroli\u2019s malformation, choledochal cyst); increased liver enzymes may reflect suppurative cholangitis or unrelated copper associated hepatopathy (CuAH) in dogs. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014anorexia; intermittent vomiting or diarrhea reflects concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or enteric hypertensive vasculopathy (splanchnic hypertension from presinusoidal PH). \u2022 Nervous\u2014episodic HE if APSS associated with CHF or if concurrent PSVA. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014stunted growth and poor body condition if CHF and APSS or if concurrent PSVA; also may reflect chronic disease, inappetence, or enteric malassimilation. \u2022 Urogenital\u2014polyuria and polydipsia (PU/ PD); possible polycystic renal phenotype; ammonium biurate urolithiasis reflects APSS or rare concurrent PSVA. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/ immune\u2014red blood cell (RBC) microcytosis reflects APSS or PSVA; neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic neutrophils and left-shifted leukon reflects sepsis due to suppurative bacterial cholangitis/choledochitis or infected choledochal cyst. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat, no sex predilection. \u2022 Juvenile and young adults predominate; dogs: mean age 1.5\u20132.5 years (0.2\u201312) years. \u2022 May affect multiple littermates. \u2022 Boxer dogs may be predisposed. \u2022 Persian cats and descendent breeds with or without polycystic renal disease appear predisposed.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 In humans (and knockout mouse models) DPM reflects gene mutations influencing structure or function of primary cilia; polycystic kidney disease in Persian cats involves polycystin-1 precursor gene, one gene influencing primary ciliary function; ~15% develop hepatic DPM. \u2022 Clinical signs usually reflect acquired complications.", "Dysautonomia (Key-Gaskell Syndrome)": " \u2022 Failure of autonomic function in multiple organs with minimal motor or sensory involvement. \u2022 Young adult, rural dogs in specific states at greatest risk. \u2022 Treatment is symptomatic and prognosis guarded. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and less commonly cat. \u2022 No breed or sex predilection. \u2022 Median age is 18 months but any age animal may be affected.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Ingestion of hair, bone, or foreign material may contribute to constipation and subsequent dyschezia. \u2022 Environmental factors such as a dirty litter pan or infrequent outside walks may contribute to constipation and subsequent dyschezia.", "Dysphagia": " \u2022 Dysphagia refers to difficulty in swallowing and is far more commonly seen in dogs than cats. \u2022 Dysphagia is divided into three main categories\u2014oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastroesophageal causes. \u2022 Oropharyngeal causes of dysphagia can be further subcategorized into oral, pharyngeal, or cricopharyngeal. \u2022 Any disorder causing difficulty with prehension or mastication can cause dysphagia. \u2022 Odynophagia refers to painful swallowing and is most commonly seen in association with pharyngitis, pharyngeal foreign bodies, esophageal foreign bodies, or severe esophagitis. \u2022 Esophageal dysphagia is discussed in Megaesophagus and in Regurgitation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The oral preparatory phase is voluntary and begins as food or liquid enters the mouth. Mastication and lubrication of food are the hallmarks of this phase. Abnormalities of the oral preparatory phase usually are associated with dental disease, xerostomia, weakness of the lips (cranial nerves [CN] V and VII), tongue (CN XII), and cheeks (CN V and VII). \u2022 The oral phase of swallowing consists of the muscular events responsible for movement of the bolus from the tongue to the pharynx and is facilitated by tongue, jaw, and hyoid muscle movements. \u2022 The pharyngeal phase begins as the bolus reaches the tonsils and is characterized by elevation of the soft palate to prevent the bolus from entering the nasopharynx, elevation and forward movement of the larynx and hyoid, retroflexion of the epiglottis and closure of the vocal folds to close the entrance into the larynx, contraction of the muscles of the pharynx, and relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle that makes up much of the proximal esophageal sphincter (PES) to allow passage of the bolus into the esophagus. Respiration is briefly halted (apneic moment) during the pharyngeal phase. \u2022 Abnormalities of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing are associated with pharyngeal weakness secondary to neuropathies or myopathies, pharyngeal tumors or foreign bodies, or cricopharyngeus muscle disorders. \u2022 The esophageal phase is involuntary and begins with relaxation of the PES and movement of the bolus into the esophagus. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal. \u2022 Nervous. \u2022 Neuromuscular. \u2022 Respiratory. GENETICS Breeds that have a hereditary predisposition or high incidence of dysphagia include golden retriever (pharyngeal weakness, cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction), cocker and springer spaniels (cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction), Bouvier des Flandres and cavalier King Charles spaniel (muscular dystrophy), and boxer (inflammatory myopathy). In addition, large and giant-breed dogs are predisposed to acquired megaesophagus. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Variable depending on underlying etiology. Megaesophagus one of the most common causes of dysphagia in dogs. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Congenital disorders that cause dysphagia (e.g., cricopharyngeal muscle achalasia, cleft palate, hiatal hernia) usually diagnosed in animals < 1 year old. \u2022 Acquired esophageal dysmotility and pharyngeal weakness more common in older patients. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Drooling (due to pain or inability to swallow saliva), gagging, ravenous appetite, repeated or exaggerated attempts at swallowing, swallowing with head in abnormal position, nasal discharge (due to nasal reflux of food and liquids into nasopharynx), coughing (due to aspiration), regurgitation, painful swallowing, and occasionally anorexia and weight loss. If tongue is not functioning normally, problems with prehension and mastication may be seen. \u2022 Ascertain onset and progression. Foreign bodies cause acute dysphagia; pharyngeal dysphagia may be chronic and insidious in onset. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Physical examination must include careful examination of oropharynx using sedation or anesthesia if necessary to help rule out morph - ologic abnormalities such as dental disease, foreign bodies, cleft palate, glossal abnormalities, and oropharyngeal tumors. \u2022 Evaluation of cranial nerves should be performed, including assessment of tongue and jaw tone, and of laryngeal function. \u2022 Complete physical and neurologic exam - ination may identify clinical signs supporting generalized neuromuscular disorder, including muscle atrophy, stiffness, or decreased or absent spinal reflexes. \u2022 Evaluate gag reflex by placing a finger in the pharynx; however, presence or absence of gag reflex does not correlate with efficacy of pharyngeal swallow nor adequacy of deglutitive airway protection. \u2022 The importance of the clinician\u2019s carefully observing the dysphagic animal while eating (kibble and canned food) and drinking in hospital (or at home via video) is pivotal, and such observation helps localize the problem to oral cavity, pharynx, or esophagus. Oral Dysp hagia \u2022 Modified eating behavior (e.g., eating with head tilted to one side or having difficulty prehending the bolus or opening the mouth). \u2022 Tongue paralysis or dystrophy, dental disease, masticatory muscle myositis, temporal muscle atrophy, or pain, and food packed in buccal folds suggest oral dysphagia. Pharyngeal Dysphagia \u2022 Prehension of food is normal. \u2022 Repeated attempts at swallowing with food falling out of mouth and excessive gagging suggest pharyngeal dysphagia. \u2022 Saliva-coated food retained in buccal folds, diminished gag reflex, and nasal discharge may also exist. Cricopharyngeal Muscle Dysfunction \u2022 Patients make repeated, nonproductive efforts to swallow, gag, and cough, then forcibly regurgitate immediately after swallowing. \u2022 Gag reflex and prehension are normal. \u2022 Nasal reflux commonly observed when food hits closed PES. \u2022 Coughing commonly observed secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Esophageal Dysphagia \u2022 Most common causes include megaesophagus, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, esophageal foreign bodies, and esophageal dysmotility. \u2022 Diagnosis made with survey radiographs of thorax and neck followed by videofluoroscopic swallow assessment. Gastroesophageal Dysphagia Most common cause is sliding hiatal hernia in brachycephalic breeds, often associated with gastroesophageal reflux and subsequent esophagitis. CAUSES \u2022 Anatomic or mechanical lesions include pharyngeal inflammation (e.g., abscess, inflammatory polyps, oral eosinophilic granuloma), neoplasia, pharyngeal and retropharyngeal foreign body, sialocele, temporomandibular joint disorders (e.g., luxation, fracture, craniomandibular osteopathy), mandibular fracture, cleft or congenitally short palate, cricopharyngeal muscle achalasia, lingual frenulum disorder, pharyngeal trauma. \u2022 Pain as result of dental disease (e.g., tooth fractures and abscess), mandibular trauma, stomatitis, glossitis, and pharyngeal inflammation may disrupt normal prehension, bolus formation, and swallowing. Stomatitis, glossitis, and pharyngitis may be secondary to feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline leukemia virus (FeLV)/feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), uremia, and ingestion of caustic agents or foreign bodies. \u2022 Neuromuscular disorders that impair prehension and bolus formation include CN deficits (e.g., idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy CN V, lingual paralysis CN XII) and masticatory muscle myositis. \u2022 Pharyngeal weakness, paresis, or paralysis can be caused by infectious polymyositis (e.g., toxoplasmosis and neosporosis), immunemediated polymyositis, muscular dystrophy, polyneuropathies, and myoneural junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis, tick bite paralysis, botulism). \u2022 Other CNS disorders, especially those involving the brainstem. \u2022 Rabies can cause dysphagia by affecting both brainstem and peripheral nerves. RISK FACTORS Many causative neuromuscular conditions have breed predispositions.", "Dyspnea and Respiratory Distress": " Dyspnea\u2014a subjective term that in human medicine means \u201can uncomfortable sensation in breathing\u201d or a sensation of air hunger; in veterinary medicine, it is used to indicate difficulty breathing or respiratory distress.

Culture-negative cases may be due to Bartonella or fungi (e.g., Aspergillus ). Less likely due to Brucella , Coxiella , Corynebacterium , and Chlamydia . PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Bacteremia from various portals of entry; bacteria invade and colonize the heart valves\u2014usually the aortic, occasionally the mitral, and rarely the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. \u2022 Endocardial ulceration exposes collagen causing platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and formation of vegetations. \u2022 Vegetations on heart valves are composed of an inner layer of platelets, fibrin, red blood cells, and bacteria; a middle layer of bacteria; and an outer layer of fibrin. \u2022 Valvular insufficiency develops in virtually all patients; aortic insufficiency almost invariably leads to intractable left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) within weeks to several months. \u2022 CHF is less frequent and latent when only the mitral valve is affected. \u2022 Vegetative lesions may dislodge causing infarction or metastatic infection to any organ; organs commonly infected include the spleen, kidneys, brain, and skeletal muscles. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014valvular insufficiency; arrhythmias, myocarditis. \u2022 Nervous\u2014para/ tetraparesis; cranial nerve deficits; abnormal mentation. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014 hypercoagulation; disseminated intravascular coagulation. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014septic or immune-mediated polyarthropathy; hyper - trophic osteopathy; discospondylitis. \u2022 Renal/ urologic\u2014renal infarction; immune-mediated glomerulonephritis; urinary tract infections. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014pulmonary edema and/or emboli. SIGNALMENT Species Dog; rarely cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Medium to large breeds. \u2022 Breeds predisposed to subaortic stenosis (SAS). Mean Age and Range Most affected dogs are 4\u20138 years of age; infection can occur at any age. Predominant Sex Most studies report male predominance\u2014 may be as great as 2 : 1. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Gram-negative bacteremia results in peracute or acute signs; Gram-positive bacteremia results in subacute or chronic clinical signs. \u2022 Systemic signs secondary to infarction, infection (inflammation), toxemia, or immune-mediated damage; usually override cardiac signs. Historical Findings \u2022 Infectious disease involving skin, oral, gastrointestinal (GI), or genital tracts (e.g., prostatitis). \u2022 Predisposing factors\u2014 immunosuppressive drug therapy, SAS, recent surgery, infected wound, abscess, pyoderma, or recent implantation of cardiovascular device (i.e., pacemaker, Amplatz\u00ae canine ductal occluder). \u2022 Presenting complaints include lethargy, paresis, fever, anorexia, GI disturbance, and lameness; in cats, cardiac decompensation and/or locomotor abnormalities are common presenting complaints.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Cause unknown for all three diseases. \u2022 Risk factors for endomyocarditis include stressful incidents such as anesthesia (commonly associated with neutering or declawing), vaccination, relocation, or bathing. \u2022 Endocardial fibroelastosis may be familial in Burmese and Siamese cats. \u2022 Appearance of EMBs in a young cat would suggest a congenital malformation.", "Entropion": " \u2022 Inversion or rolling in of eyelid margin, resulting in frictional irritation of cornea and/ or conjunctiva from contact with outer surface of eyelid. \u2022 May result in keratitis, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. \u2022 Can be conformational/congenital (primary) or acquired (secondary). \u2022 Severe corneal disease may threaten vision. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Common in dogs\u2014seen in chow chow, Chinese Shar-Pei, Norwegian elkhound, sporting breeds (e.g., spaniel, retriever), brachycephalic breeds, toy breeds, and giant breeds; age\u2014puppies as early as 2\u20136 weeks old; usually identified in dogs < 1 year old. \u2022 Cats\u2014usually in brachycephalic breeds, in young cats due to chronic ocular surface disease, and older animals due to retrobulbar fat loss. SIGNS \u2022 Mild, medial\u2014chronic epiphora and medial pigmentary keratitis (toy dogs and brachycephalic dogs and cats). \u2022 Mild, lateral\u2014chronic mucoid to mucopurulent ocular discharge (giant-breed dogs). \u2022 Upper lid, lower lid, or lateral canthal\u2014 severe blepharospasm, purulent discharge, pigmentary or ulcerative keratitis, potential cornea rupture (chow chow, shar-pei, bloodhound, sporting breeds). \u2022 Cats\u2014often have associated keratoconjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, or corneal sequestrum (brown-black corneal opacity). CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Genetic predisposition\u2014based on facial conformation and eyelid support. \u2022 Brachycephalic breeds (dogs and cats)\u2014 excessive tension on ligamentous structures of medial canthus plus nasal folds and facial conformation results in rolling inward of medial aspects of upper and lower eyelids at the medial canthus. \u2022 Giant breeds and breeds with excessive eyelid length (macroblepharon), heavy/loose facial skin, or excessive facial folds\u2014laxity of lateral canthus allows entropion of upper and lower eyelids and lateral canthus. \u2022 Spastic entropion\u2014from ocular irritation (e.g., distichia, ectopic cilia, trichiasis, foreign body, irritant conjunctivitis); leads to excessive blepharospasm. \u2022 Non-predisposed breeds\u2014may be primary irritant causing secondary spastic entropion. \u2022 Loss of orbital fat or periorbital musculature may lead to enophthalmos and entropion. \u2022 Secondary cicatricial entropion\u2014from scarring due to eyelid wounds or eyelid surgery. \u2022 Cats\u2014chronic infectious conjunctivitis or keratitis: may lead to functional entropion caused by chronic blepharospasm (spastic entropion); also in older cats due to enophthalmos from retrobulbar fat loss.", "Eosinophilia": " \u2022 Eosinophilia refers to an increased number of circulating eosinophils. \u2022 Reference intervals may be difficult to accurately determine, as numbers do not tend to have normal (Gaussian) distribution. Absolute counts >1.5 x 10 3 / \u03bc l often indicate clinically significant eosinophilia. \u2022 Diseases associated with eosinophilia are highly variable. However, they often involve those causing release of cytokines including IL-5, IL-2, IL-3, and/or GM-CSF. \u2022 Prevalence varies; 4.8% of cats and 10% of dogs have been identified with eosinophilia in large retrospective studies. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Breed and sex predilections are directly correlated to the characteristics of specific diseases. \u2022 Rottweilers and German shepherd dogs show the highest overall prevalence of eosinophilia. SIGNS \u2022 Clinical signs directly associated with eosinophilia per se are lacking. \u2022 Specific clinical signs are dependent on the disease causing the eosinophilia. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Diseases associated with eosinophilia are widely variable and can be categorized in many ways. \u2022 Infectious diseases typically involve tissues rather than peripheral blood, and are more likely to be parasitic than bacterial. \u2022 Tissues involved are frequently those that contain abundant mast cells, such as skin, lungs, and intestine, and often involve hypersensitivity. \u2022 Metabolic\u2014hypoadrenocortisim. \u2022 Neoplastic\u2014mast cell tumor; eosinophilic leukemia; lymphoma (both T-cell and B-cell); thymoma; mammary carcinoma; oral fibrosarcoma; transitional cell carcinoma. \u2022 Immune mediated\u2014hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES); idiopathic HES in Rottweilers; feline asthma; eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy; feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia; flea bite allergy; eosinophilic granuloma complex. \u2022 Infectious\u2014 Angiostrongylus vasorum ; heartworm disease ( Dirofilaria immitis ); Ehrlichia spp. infections; Anaplasma spp. infections; histoplasmosis; sarcocytosis; Aelurostrongylus spp.; larval migration of various parasites. \u2022 Toxic methimazole therapy.", "Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex": " \u2022 Cats\u2014also called feline eosinophilic skin disease; term used for three distinct syndromes: eosinophilic plaque, eosinophilic granuloma, and indolent ulcer; grouped primarily according to their clinical similarities, their frequent concurrent (and recurrent) development, and their positive response to corticosteroids; reaction pattern and not a final diagnosis unless idiopathic. \u2022 Dogs\u2014 eosinophilic granuloma in dogs (EGD) rare; specific differences from cats listed separately. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Eosinophil\u2014major infiltrative cell for eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophilic plaque, but not typically with indolent ulcer; most often associated with allergic or parasitic conditions but has a more general role in inflammatory reactions. \u2022 Eosinophilic granuloma complex (EGC)\u2014most often in cats with hypersensitivities to inhaled allergens, food, or insects, but can also be idiopathic with possible genetic causes. \u2022 EGD\u2014may have both a genetic predisposition and a hypersensitivity cause (especially in non\u00adgenetically susceptible breeds).

SIGNALMENT \u2022 Labrador retrievers\u2014approximately 6% of all pet, show, and field Labrador retrievers are affected. \u2022 Also occurs in Chesapeake Bay retrievers, curly-coated retrievers, and Boykin spaniels, and rarely in Old English sheepdogs, German wirehaired pointers, Bouvier des Flandres, Pembroke Welsh corgis, and cocker spaniels. \u2022 No sex or color predilection. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 No systemic signs. \u2022 Episodes of collapse first occur between 5 months and 3 years of age. \u2022 Collapse episodes occur only with extremes of exciting exercise. \u2022 Dogs can engage normally in hiking, swimming, jogging, and other activities. Physical Examination Findings Between weakness/collapse episodes, physical and neurologic examinations are normal. Features of Weakness/Collapse Episodes \u2022 Weakness occurs after 5\u201320 minutes of intense exercise with excitement or stress. \u2022 Rear limbs become weak and unable to support weight. \u2022 Rear limb muscles are flaccid during collapse and there is a loss of patellar reflexes. \u2022 Dogs may continue to run, dragging their rear limbs in a crouched posture. \u2022 During a severe episode, all four limbs can be affected; rarely the dog may become recumbent and unable to move its limbs or raise its head. \u2022 Dogs remain conscious and fully alert during episodes. \u2022 There is no apparent pain or discomfort on palpation or manipulation of the muscles, joints, or spine during or after collapse. \u2022 Complete recovery occurs within 5\u201330 minutes. \u2022 Rectal temperature is elevated (mean > 107 \u00b0F; > 41.6 \u00b0C), but not different from Labradors without exercise-induced collapse doing similar exercise. \u2022 A few dogs with exercise-induced collapse (EIC) have died during collapse\u2014death is usually preceded by a short generalized seizure. The cause of death is uncertain, but weakness of the respiratory muscles and extreme hyperthermia are suspected. CAUSES \u2022 Genetic disorder\u2014inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. \u2022 Symptomatic dogs are homozygous for a mutation in the dynamin 1 gene. Dynamin 1 ( DNM1 ) is a protein important in neurotransmission in the brain and spinal cord during high-level neuronal activity. There is evidence that the DNM1 mutation associated with EIC has its most profound effect on DNM1 function when body temperature is elevated, as normally occurs with exercise. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Genetically affected dogs are at risk for collapse when participating in high-intensity exercise with concurrent excitement or stress. \u2022 Trigger activities most likely to induce collapse include repetitive fun or training retrieves, upland bird hunting, intense play with other dogs, and running alongside an all-terrain vehicle. \u2022 Increased ambient temperature and humidity increase the risk of collapse in affected dogs. \u2022 Most genetically affected dogs ( > 80%) will have at least one episode of collapse before they reach 3 years of age, but affected dogs with a sedentary lifestyle or calm temperament may never exhibit weakness or collapse.", "Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency": " Syndrome that is caused by inadequate amounts of pancreatic digestive enzymes in the small intestinal lumen. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Most commonly caused by insufficient synthesis and secretion of pancreatic enzymes by the exocrine pancreas. \u2022 In rare cases can be caused by an obstruction of the pancreatic duct or isolated lipase deficiency. \u2022 Insufficient synthesis of pancreatic digestive enzymes can be due to destruction of acinar cells resulting from chronic pancreatitis (approximately 50% of cases in dogs and almost all cases in cats) or can be due to idiopathic pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA; most common cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in German shepherd dogs). \u2022 Deficient exocrine pancreatic secretion results in maldigestion and nutrient malabsorption, leading to weight loss and loose stools with steatorrhea. \u2022 Malabsorption contributes to small intestinal dysbiosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nutritional\u2014protein-calorie malnourish- ment. GENETICS Assumed to be hereditary in the German shepherd dog and probably transmitted by a complex trait (early studies have suggested an autosomal recessive trait, but this is no longer believed to be the case). INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 PAA is very commonly seen in the German shepherd dog; it is less commonly seen in rough-coated collies and Eurasians. \u2022 Other causes of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) may be seen in all dog and cat breeds. \u2022 Less common in cats than in dogs. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections German shepherd dogs, rough-coated collies, and Eurasians. Mean Age and Range \u2022 PAA in young adult dogs. \u2022 Chronic pancreatitis in dogs and cats of any age. Predominant Sex No sex predilection. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Consider in young adult (age range approx- imately 1\u20134 years) German shepherd dogs with weight loss and loose stools. \u2022 Severity\u2014varies depending on time until diagnosis and therapy.

The term false pregnancy is a misnomer, since the pattern of hormonal changes is normal. \u2022 Physical, hormonal, and behavioral changes following a nonfertile mating or spontaneous ovulation in the queen. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hormone profile of pregnant and nonpregnant bitch very similar following ovulation. \u2022 All cycling bitches undergo a lengthy (2+ months) diestrus following ovulation. \u2022 Mammary development and behavioral changes occur under the influence of progesterone and prolactin in late diestrus. \u2022 Galactorrhea (excessive production and inappropriate excretion of milk) is seen following a rise in serum prolactin at the end of diestrus, and also in dogs with severe hypothyroidism due to resulting hyperprolactinemia. \u2022 False pregnancies in the bitch are thought to occur as a holdover from a period in evolution when females of a pack would cycle at the same time, but only dominant individuals would become pregnant. Nonpregnant pack members were available to nurse puppies of the more dominant females. \u2022 Any event that results in an abrupt drop in serum progesterone and rise in prolactin can lead to a clinically overt false pregnancy. Signs are frequently created iatrogenically when ovariectomy (OVE) or ovariohysterectomy (OHE) is performed during mid to late diestrus. \u2022 Queens that ovulate spontaneously or ovulate following mating but do not become pregnant experience a 6\u20137-week period of diestrus due to elevated progesterone concentrations; some queens develop a clinically overt false pregnancy during this time.

The response of the autonomic nervous system prepares the body for \u201cfreeze, fight, or flight.\u201d As such, it is a normal behavior, essential for adaptation and survival. \u2022 Anxiety is the anticipation of dangers from unknown or imagined origins that results in physiologic reactions associated with fear. Anxiety may occur in the aftermath of a fear-producing event or as a result of unrelated environmental changes that are unpredictable. \u2022 A phobia is a persistent and excessive fear of a specific stimulus, such as a thunderstorm or separation from an attachment figure. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Stress responses become problematic when the individual is not able to control the stressful situation by their actions or escape from it through appropriate behavioral responses. \u2022 Chronic anxiety or fear can lead to secondary behavior problems, such as overgrooming, spraying, or intercat aggression, or predispose the cat to health problems owing to a compromised immune system.

Alveolar osteitis most commonly occurs over the maxillary canine tooth roots of middle-aged and older cats (sometimes also called buttressing). This process appears to be secondary to periodontal inflammation. Tooth resorption and extrusion (supereruption) may also be seen in affected teeth. Feline alveolar osteitis should be distinguished from benign alveolar bone expansion (also called buccal bone expansion), which is devoid of inflammation. SIGNALMENT Although alveolar osteitis can occur in dogs, it is far more common in cats. There are no established breed or sex predilections, and no established genetic basis. Middle-aged and older cats are most commonly affected. SIGNS History \u2022 Owner may report thickening or bulging over the maxillary canine teeth roots, usually bilateral, but can be unilateral. \u2022 Evidence of oral pain is not often noted by pet owners. \u25e6 Discomfort may occur with mobile teeth. \u25e6 Discomfort may occur when extruded maxillary canine teeth contact the lower lip or the opposing canine, resulting in an acquired malocclusion.

It is the most common urinary disorder of young to middle-aged cats and is characterized by dysuria, pollakiuria, hematuria, periuria, and in some cases urinary obstruction. Clinical observations suggest that FIC is associated with different clinical phenotypes (acute self-limiting, chronic, nonobstructive, and obstructive forms) and pathologic phenotypes (ulcerative, inflammatory, hyperplastic, nonulcerative, and noninflammatory forms). Regardless of form, the terms idiopathic lower urinary tract disease and FIC represent an exclusionary diagnosis established only after known causes have been eliminated. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Etiopathogenesis is uncertain. \u2022 Urinary bladder abnormalities include alterations in urothelial barrier structure and function, differentiation and repair, signaling, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and innate immune and inflammatory responses. \u2022 Association of FIC with stress (environmental, psychologic, physiologic, or comorbid pathologic stressors) and identification of multiple abnormalities of nervous and endocrine systems have led to hypothesis that systemic psychoneuroendocrine factors may have a role in the pathogenesis. \u2022 Clinical and morphologic features of chronic forms of FIC are similar to those of an idiopathic cystopathy of humans called interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). However, the extent to which the feline and human forms share pathogenic mechanisms has not yet been fully defined. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014lower urinary tract. \u2022 Persistent urethral outflow obstruction results in postrenal azotemia. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Incidence of hematuria, dysuria, and/or urethral obstruction (UO) in domestic cats has been previously reported to be ~0.5\u20131% per year. \u2022 Hospital morbidity rate for FIC in cats with lower urinary tract signs is ~65%; it is the single most common cause of lower urinary tract signs in cats.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The term feline coronavirus (FCoV) encompasses feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). \u2022 FECV is common and highly infectious; replicates locally in intestinal tract. \u2022 FIPV infects monocytes/macrophages, which disseminate virus throughout body; localizes at vein wall and perivascular sites. \u2022 FIP is an immune-mediated disease\u2014 perivascular accumulation of virus-infected macrophages and inflammatory cells produces pyogranulomatous inflammation in various organs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Multisystemic\u2014pyogranulomatous or granulomatous lesions on omentum, serosal surface of abdominal organs, within abdominal lymph nodes, and submucosa of intestinal tract. \u2022 Nervous\u2014vascular lesions throughout CNS, especially in meninges. \u2022 Ophthalmic\u2014uveitis, chorioretinitis, and iritis. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014lesions on lung surfaces, pleural effusion.

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide SIGNALMENT Species Cats\u2014domestic and exotic. Breed Predilections Some bloodlines or breeds of cats may be more susceptible. Mean Age and Range Highest incidence in kittens 3 months\u20132 years of age. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Variable, depending on effectiveness of cell-mediated immune response, and organ system(s) affected. \u2022 Two classic forms\u2014wet (effusive) and dry (noneffusive); depends on presence of effusion in body cavities; dry form may become wet form with disease progression. Historical Findings \u2022 Insidious onset. \u2022 Gradual weight loss and inappetence. \u2022 Stunted growth in kittens. \u2022 Gradual increase in size of abdomen due to effusion. \u2022 Persistent fever\u2014fluctuating, antibiotic unresponsive.

CAUSES \u2022 Prevailing theory is that FECV mutates to FIPV during FECV infection in individual cats; weak cell-mediated immunity plays a role in development of FIP. \u2022 FCoV has two genomic types (FCoV type 1 and 2) and two biotypes (FECV and FIPV). \u2022 FCoV type 1 is predominant (>85%); both types 1 and 2 can cause FIP. \u2022 FECV\u2014enteritis; highly transmissible among cats. \u2022 FIPV\u2014systemic, fatal disease (FIP); cat-to-cat transmission unlikely. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Contact with FECV-shedding cat; >30% of cats are chronic shedders. \u2022 Breeding catteries or multicat facilities. \u2022 Less than 2 years of age. \u2022 Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. \u2022 Certain cat breeds have higher incidence of FIP, especially dry form; some breeding pairs are prone to producing litters that develop FIP.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In feline ischemic encephalopathy (FIE), Cuterebra larva enters nasal passage of cat, migrates through cribriform plate into olfactory bulb of the brain, then along olfactory peduncle and sometimes continues in parenchyma of brain, or alternatively in subarachnoid space; parasite then, if still alive, migrates caudally, where it may compromise the middle cerebral artery (MCA) physically through spines on the larvae\u2019s body, or possibly via chemical agent secreted by parasite causing vasospasm to vessel; or vasospasm may be secondary to hemorrhage caused by parasite; parasite may then die in subarachnoid space (SAS) or within parenchyma. \u2022 Adult botfly lays eggs by entrance of rodent\u2019s den; eggs hatch into L1 stage of larva, which attaches to hair of mouse or rabbit and enters body through a normal orifice (mouth, nose, eye, or anus) and migrates into associated tissues (nasopharynx, trachea, thoracic cavity, diaphragm, abdominal cavity); then larva continues its migration to reach subcutaneous site in inguinal or thoracic region where it matures first to L2 stage and then within warble to L3 larval stage, emerges through skin, drops off host, pupates in soil over winter, and then emerges in spring as an adult botfly. Adult lays eggs near entrance of rodent\u2019s den; eggs hatch to form L1 larvae\u2026 When cat hunts near rodent\u2019s den, L1 larva attaches to cat\u2019s hair and gains access to nasal passage of cat and begins catastrophic pathway of FIE. \u2022 Occasionally larva does not migrate through cribriform plate but embeds in nasal passage or respiratory tract of cat, causing focal respiratory signs; larva has also been found in the eye and oropharyngeal region.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Odontoclasts deriving from hematopoietic stem cells migrate to the external root surface, where they start resorption of cementum and dentin. \u2022 TR is often preceded by dentoalveolar ankylosis (fusion between alveolar bone and the root with disappearance of the periodontal ligament space). The alveolar bone (already in a state of constant resorption and apposition) will then include the tooth in its normal remodeling process, which results in noninflammatory replacement resorption. If TR progresses coronally and emerges at the gingival margin, an inflammatory component through contact with oral bacteria joins the initially noninflammatory process, and inflamed granulation tissue may form to cover defects in the crown of the tooth (inflammatory resorption). \u2022 TR in cats most commonly starts anywhere on the external root (not crown) surface and not just close to the cementoenamel junction. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Gastrointestinal\u2014oral cavity. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE At least one-third of cats may develop TR during life, with the risk of developing TR increasing with age. Reported prevalence (25\u201375%) greatly depends on the population of animals investigated (general practice versus dental specialist practice) and the diagnostic methods applied (observation only, tactile exploration with an instrument, and/or use of dental radiography). SIGNALMENT Species Cats Breed Predilections Persian longhaired cats reported to have TR at a younger age compared with other breeds. Mean Age and Range Rarely seen in cats less than 2 years of age; first teeth usually affected at 4\u20136 years of age. SIGNS Historical Findings Most affected cats do not show clinical signs, in particular when teeth are affected by replacement resorption only (which is asymptomatic) and the TR is located apical to the gingival attachment (not yet exposed to oral bacteria); some show dropping of food while eating, reluctance to eat hard food, and repetitive lower jaw motions (\u201cchattering\u201d). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Dental deposits, hyperplastic gingiva, and granulation tissue often cover a clinically evident TR emerging at the gingival margin. A dental explorer can be used under general anesthesia to detect irregularities at the tooth surface near the gingival margin. \u2022 TR occurs more often on the labial and buccal aspects of premolar and molar teeth, and less commonly on canine and incisor teeth. The mandibular third premolar teeth are usually the first teeth affected by TR. \u2022 Canine teeth (in particular maxillary) often appear to extrude excessively (abnormal tooth extrusion), leading to exposure of the root surface. Thickening of alveolar bone with local osteomyelitis (alveolar bone expansion) is often associated with this phenomenon. Classification of Tooth Resorption \u2022 American Veterinary Dental College (AVDC) currently suggests classification based on the severity (stages 1\u20135) and radiographic appearance of the resorption (types 1\u20133): \u25e6 Stage 1 (TR1)\u2014mild dental hard tissue loss (cementum or cementum and enamel). \u25e6 Stage 2 (TR2)\u2014moderate dental hard tissue loss (cementum or cementum and enamel with loss of dentin that does not extend to the pulp cavity). \u25e6 Stage 3 (TR3)\u2014deep dental hard tissue loss (cementum or cementum and enamel with loss of dentin that extends to the pulp cavity) with most of the tooth still retaining its integrity. \u25e6 Stage 4 (TR4)\u2014extensive dental hard tissue loss (cementum or cementum and enamel with loss of dentin that extends to the pulp cavity) with most of the tooth having lost its integrity; there are substages TR4a (crown and root equally affected), TR4b (crown more severely affected than root, and TR4c (root more severely affected than crown). \u25e6 Stage 5 (TR5)\u2014remnants of dental hard tissue are visible only as irregular radiopacities with complete gingival covering. \u2022 See Imaging for additional classification scheme (types 1\u20133). CAUSES \u2022 Etiology is unknown; possibly multifactorial (e.g., nutritional, inflammatory, and hereditary). \u2022 One hypothesis is that chronic dietary intake of excess vitamin D would lead to periodontal ligament degeneration, hypercementosis, hyperosteoidosis, narrowing of the periodontal ligament space, dentoalveolar ankylosis, and replacement resorption. If such a process occurred close to the gingival attachment, an inflammatory component would join the initially noninflammatory disease.", "Feline (Upper) Respiratory Infections": " \u2022 Viral, bacterial, fungal etiologies. \u2022 Most cats harbor viral causes and become clinical with stress. \u2022 Viral upper respiratory infection (URI) very common, secondary bacterial infections common; primary bacterial rhinitis uncommon. \u2022 Most organisms spread through direct contact, air (droplets from coughing, sneezing, or discharge), and contaminated surfaces (e.g., shared bowls, cages). \u2022 Illness typified by rhinosinusitis, conjunctivitis, lacrimation, salivation, oral ulcerations.

Some dogs with irritable bowel syndrome respond to dietary fiber supplementation, while others require stress alleviation, antispasmodic medications, and/or anti-anxiety drugs. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs of all ages (0.5\u201314 years); median 6 years. \u2022 Many breeds, including mixed breeds; common breeds include German shepherd dog, miniature schnauzer, cocker spaniel, and miniature or toy poodle. SIGNS \u2022 Chronic diarrhea (soft to liquid) with classic large bowel characteristics; tenesmus, excess fecal mucus, hematochezia, increased frequency (median 3.5 times/day), and urgency. \u2022 Diarrhea usually episodic alternating with periods of normal stool; diarrhea may be continuous in approximately 25% of dogs. \u2022 Less common signs include occasional vomiting, decreased appetite during episodes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and anal pruritus. \u2022 Weight loss rare. \u2022 Stress factors or abnormal personality traits in approximately 35% of dogs; household visitation, travel, moving, construction, instillation of an invisible fence; recent adoption or considered nervous, high-strung, sensitive, or aggressive; or possess noise phobia, anxiety, or depressive disorders. \u2022 Physical examination reveals no significant findings related to gastrointestinal tract. \u2022 Digital rectal examination is usually normal. Feces may be normal due to episodic nature of the disease. Loose stool may be present and it may contain hematochezia (red blood) or excess mucus. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Unknown; stress or abnormal personality traits may play a role in some. \u2022 Clinical response to dietary soluble fiber supplementation suggests abnormal colonic motility and/or dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is defined as a microbial imbalance within the gastrointestinal tract. Soluble dietary fiber is a prebiotic, fermented by colonic bacteria resulting in altered composition or activity of bacteria. Prebiotics are not digested by mammalian digestive enzymes and \u201cfeed\u201d colonic bacteria, potentially correcting dysbiosis. Soluble fibers also adsorb water, improving stool quality.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Passing flatus is a normal physiologic function in the dog and cat. Variations in the volume, odor, and frequency of the pet\u2019s flatus may cause the owner to perceive the act of flatulence as a problem. \u2022 Swallowed air (aerophagia), bacterial fermentation of nutrients, the interaction of gastric acid and pancreatic/salivary bicarbonate, and diffusion of gases from blood are the main sources of GI gas. \u2022 Odorless gases comprise more than 99% of GI gases; these include nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. \u2022 Malodorous gases containing volatile sulfur compounds comprise less than 1% of GI gases; these include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, indole, skatole, volatile amines, and short-chain fatty acids. \u2022 Dogs and cats lack digestive enzymes to cleave oligosaccharides (commonly of vegetable source) into absorbable monosaccharides. Diets high in oligosaccharides provide substrate for colonic microbiota fermentation and lead to excessive gas formation. \u2022 Foods containing fermentable fibers (including pectins, gums, and carrageenan) contribute to flatus directly by fermentation of the fiber by colonic microbiota. \u2022 Dogs and cats are lactose intolerant; a dietary concentration of 1.5 g/kg/day (there is 11 g lactose in 1 cup of milk) may produce flatulence and diarrhea. \u2022 Hypersensitivity or intolerance to certain proteins or carbohydrates is often responsible for increased volume or odor of flatus. \u2022 Disease states causing malassimilation of nutrients (such as protein-losing enteropathies [PLEs] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), making them available for colonic fermentation, can cause increased flatulence. \u2022 Infection with certain enteropathogenic organisms, such as Giardia sp., can cause increased flatulence. \u2022 Antibiotics that alter the colonic microbiota may cause increased flatulence. SYSTEMS AFFECTED GI GENETICS No known genetic basis, although brachycephalic breeds are overrepresented.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Unknown. \u2022 Intestinal parasites, infection, or inflammation may damage the intestinal mucosa, resulting in the abnormal absorption of allergens and subsequent sensitization.", "Food Reactions (Gastrointestinal), Adverse": " \u2022 Adverse food reactions encompass disorders with an immunologic (food allergy), nonimmunologic (food intolerance), and toxic basis (food intoxication). \u2022 Food allergy, food intolerance, and food intoxication may have similar signs, diagnostics, and treatments and may not be easily distinguishable. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The pathogenesis of food allergy involves complex immunologic events\u2014a leaky intestinal mucosal barrier, dysregulated immune responses, and loss of oral tolerance. Most food allergies are due to type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Major food allergens include milk, eggs, beef, chicken, and plant proteins from corn, wheat, and soybeans. \u2022 Food intolerance may be due to idiosyncratic reactions to dietary ingredients or additives, pharmacologic reactions to compounds in the diet, defects or deficiencies in the metabolic pathways needed to use the food, or a toxicity reaction to food ingredients or spoiled foodstuffs. Unlike food allergy, food intolerance requires no previous exposure to the food product. \u2022 Toxic reactions to food may occur when a foodstuff is ingested in large amounts (e.g., onion poisoning). \u2022 Toxicity reactions occur when food contains toxins (e.g., aflatoxin, a hepatotoxin produced by Aspergillus spp.) or has spoiled or been contaminated by bacterial growth. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014small intestine, colon, and/or stomach can be affected by adverse food reactions. \u2022 Skin/exocrine\u2014food allergy can manifest with concurrent dermatologic signs or exclusive dermatologic signs.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The mechanism and etiology are poorly understood. Many risk factors have been evaluated. Rotation of the stomach can occur in any direction, but the majority occur in clockwise rotation. The pylorus, pyloric antrum, and proximal duodenum move from dorsal to ventral, from right to left of the patient, continuing from the ventral abdomen to the left, and eventually are located in the left dorsal quadrant of the peritoneal cavity. With distention of the stomach, intraabdominal pressure increases. Collapse of the compliant abdominal venous network leads to decreased venous return to the heart and portal hypertension. As the disease progresses, hypovolemic shock and decreased organ perfusion lead to local and systemic inflammatory response, visceral and myocardial ischemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and eventually cardiovascular collapse and death. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014rotation of the stomach causes venous congestion of the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and proximal small intestine and arterial compromise of the stomach. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014splenic engorgement, vascular compromise, ischemia, and thrombosis are common. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014both distributive and obstructive hypovolemic shock may be seen; cardiac arrhythmias are common. \u2022 Renal/ urologic\u2014acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur secondary to shock and renal vascular compression. \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been reported, likely secondary to AKI, endotoxemia, and systemic inflammatory responses. GENETICS \u2022 Having a first-order relative with a history of GDV markedly increases the risk of developing GDV. \u2022 While the genetic basis is unknown, it is likely to be a complex, multifactorial (or polygenic) disorder. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE One study indicated that likelihood of a purebred large- or giant-breed dog developing GDV during its lifetime is approximately 24% and 21.6%, respectively.

This abnormal gastric retention may, in turn, cause gastric distention, and subsequent signs of anorexia, nausea, bloating, and vomiting. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The stomach has two distinct motor regions. The proximal stomach (fundus and body) relaxes to accommodate ingested food and regulates the expulsion of liquids. Intrinsic slow contractions of this region push liquids toward the pylorus. The distal stomach (antrum) mechanically breaks down solids through strong peristaltic contractions and ultimately expels them. The gastric pacemaker, an area of intrinsic electrical activity located in the greater curvature of the stomach, regulates distal gastric motility and emptying. Gastric electrical activity, dietary composition, and extrinsic factors (e.g., vagal and sympathetic innervation) all influence emptying. During fasting, indigestible solids are expelled from the stomach by migrating myoelectric complexes (MMCs). These produce strong \u201cdigestive housekeeper\u201d contractions that, in the fasted state, sweep through the stomach and small intestine to mid-jejunum every 2 hours, preparing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for the next meal. MMCs are regulated by the hormone motilin. Dysrhythmias in normal gastric electrical activity may be fundamental in the patho physiology of disorders affecting gastric motility, but may also be secondary to gastric inflammation, neoplasia, and overdistension. SYSTEMS AFFECTED GI GENETICS Not applicable INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Unknown. Many factors can alter gastric emptying, although they may not result in clinical disease or may only partially contribute to signs. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Unknown Mean Age and Range Signs occur at any age, though it is uncommon to observe primary motility disorders in young animals. Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS General Comments Clinical signs are often secondary to the primary etiology causing the gastric motility disorder. Historical Findings \u2022 Major clinical sign is chronic postprandial vomiting of food; stomach should normally be empty after average-sized meal in approx 6\u20138 hours in dogs and 4\u20136 hours in cats (note: normal emptying times vary greatly from animal to animal and are influenced by meal volume, caloric density, fiber content, and environmental factors, e.g., stress); vomiting of undigested food > 12 hours following meal suggests abnormal gastric motility or outflow obstruction; vomiting can occur, however, any time after eating. \u2022 Gastric distention, nausea, anorexia, belching, bloating, pica, and weight loss may occur. \u2022 Distal esophageal sphincter may be incompetent with gastric hypomotility and signs associated with reflux esophagitis may occur. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Normal or findings associated with underlying cause. \u2022 Palpation of large, distended stomach. \u2022 Decreased gastric sounds on abdominal auscultation. CAUSES \u2022 Rarely, idiopathic gastric motility disorders arise from primary defects in normal myoelectric activity, e.g., myenteric ganglionitis, intestinal leiomyositis; most motility disorders occur secondary to other conditions. \u2022 Metabolic disorders include hypokalemia, uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypothyroidism. \u2022 Nervous inhibition as result of stress, fear, pain, or trauma. \u2022 Drugs such as anticholinergics, beta-adrenergic agonists, narcotics, and chemotherapeutics. \u2022 Primary gastric disease such as outflow obstructions, gastritis, gastric ulcers, parvovirus, and gastric surgery. \u2022 Gastric dilatation and volvulus syndrome (GDV) is suspected to be, in part, result of abnormal gastric motility associated with changes in myoelectric and mechanical activity, although whether primary or secondary to overstretching of gastric wall is unknown; some dogs with GDV may continue to have signs of gastric hypomotility following surgical gastropexy. \u2022 Gastroesophageal reflux and enterogastric reflux (see Bilious Vomiting Syndrome) may result from primary gastric hypomotility. \u2022 Dysautonomia may affect GI tract and result in abnormal esophageal, gastric, and intestinal motility. RISK FACTORS Any gastric disease may result in secondary hypomotility.", "Gastritis, Chronic": " Inflammation of the stomach leading to clinical signs of >3 weeks\u2019 duration.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Gastroduodenal ulceration/erosion (GUE) results from factors that damage or overwhelm normal gastric mucosal defense and repair mechanisms. \u2022 Factors protecting the stomach from GUE include the mucus/ bicarbonate layer, gastric epithelial cell turnover, gastric mucosal blood flow, and local prostaglandins. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014ulcers and erosion are most common in stomach, followed by proximal duodenum; however, neoplasia and some drugs (e.g., flunixin meglumine) can cause ulceration anywhere in GI tract. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hemorrhage may cause anemia, tachycardia, systolic heart murmur, and/or hypotension. \u2022 Peritoneal cavity\u2014perforation may cause peritonitis/sepsis/ systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

CAUSES Drugs \u2022 NSAIDs\u2014cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs are usually safer than nonselective NSAIDs; however, GUE and perforation can occur with all NSAIDs. Coadministration of glucocorticoids (either systemic or local) enhances ulcerogenic potential of NSAIDs. Some NSAIDs are renowned for being extremely ulcerogenic (flunixin meglumine, naproxen, indomethacin). \u2022 Glucocorticoids\u2014 dexamethasone is most ulcerogenic. Prednisolone less likely to cause clinically significant GUE unless there are additional stress factors (e.g., hypoxemia, hypoperfusion). GI Diseases \u2022 GI neoplasia\u2014carcinomas are most common cause of neoplastic ulceration, but leiomyomas/leiomyosarcomas may cause severe hemorrhage. \u2022 Foreign bodies can be associated with GUE, but not a common cause. Intestinal foreign bodies (especially linear foreign bodies) commonly cause intestinal ulceration/perforation. \u2022 Gastric hyperacidity. Infectious Diseases Pythiosis can cause severe GUE.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Many conditions result in hemorrhagic diarrhea, but the acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) of dogs appears to have unique clinical features that distinguish it from other conditions. \u2022 AHDS results in a peracute loss of intestinal mucosal integrity with the rapid movement of fluid and electrolytes into the gut lumen. Dehydration and hypovolemic shock occur quickly. In proportion to fluid loss, blood loss is usually minor. This has to be differentiated from true gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, in which anemia is usually observed. Protein loss can be substantial in some cases, resulting in severe hypoalbuminemia. Translocation of bacteria or toxins through the damaged intestinal mucosa can usually be compensated. In a few cases the immune defense mechanisms can be overwhelmed, resulting in septicemia/septic shock. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 GI. \u2022 Cardiovascular. GENETICS Unknown; small or toy breeds appear to be overrepresented. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Unknown; appears to be common. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Dog Breed Predilections \u2022 Any breed can be affected; incidence is greater in small and toy breeds. \u2022 Breeds most represented include Yorkshire terrier, miniature pinscher, miniature schnauzer, miniature poodle, and Maltese. Mean Age and Range Usually in adult dogs with a mean age of 5 years. Predominant Sex Not applicable SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Mucosal lesions are restricted to the intestines and cannot be detected in the stomach histologically; therefore, it is suggested to replace the term hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), implicating gastric inflammation, with AHDS. \u2022 Most animals affected are previously healthy with no historical environmental changes; some dogs have a history of chronic intermittent GI disease. \u2022 Clinical findings are variable in both the course and severity of the disease; the disease is usually acute to peracute; with adequate fluid and symptomatic treatment, rapid clinical improvement is typically observed in the first 48 hours. Historical Findings \u2022 Acute vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy, followed by watery diarrhea quickly changing to bloody diarrhea. \u2022 Signs progress rapidly and become severe within a period of <12 hours as a result of hypovolemic shock and hemoconcentration. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Evidence of hypovolemia; lethargy, weakness, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, and weak pulse pressure. \u2022 Skin turgor as a reflection of dehydration may appear normal owing to the peracute nature of the disease and the lag time in compartmental fluid shifts. \u2022 Abdominal pain and fluid-filled bowel can be detected. \u2022 Rectal examination identifies bloody diarrhea, and later in the course of disease a \u201craspberry jam\u201d characteristic stool develops. \u2022 Often normo- or hypothermia; fever is unusual and represents an important feature differentiating uncomplicated AHDS cases from dogs with infection and systemic reaction to an enteropathogen or septicemia following bacterial translocation. CAUSES \u2022 There is increasing evidence to suggest that Clostridium perfringens type A is involved, as these bacteria have been identified on necrotic mucosal surfaces closely associated with epithelial lesions. \u2022 A novel pore-forming toxin designated NetF was detected in C. perfringens type A strains, which were involved in AHDS; compared to healthy control dogs (prevalence: 0\u201310%), the prevalence of C. perfringens encoding the netF gene is significantly higher in dogs with AHDS (50\u201355%). \u2022 Other undetected clostridial toxins might be involved in the disease process; it is also possible that different etiologies are responsible for this syndrome in different patients.

Obstructions in the pharynx, esophagus, large intestine, and rectum, and motility disorders, are addressed in separate chapters. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Mechanical obstruction commonly results from indiscriminate ingestion of foreign material, the presence of a gastrointestinal (GI) mass, or intussusception. \u2022 The accumulation of ingesta and GI secretions orad to the obstruction causes local vascular compromise, resulting in intestinal wall edema, necrosis, and possible sepsis. \u2022 Decreased oral intake, vomiting, and sequestration of GI secretions result in acid-base and electrolyte imbalances. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hypovolemic or septic shock can result from fluid loss or GI translocation of bacteria. \u2022 GI\u2014GI obstructions cause pathology by distension and compression of the GI tract orad to the obstruction; this results in decreased blood flow to the area with subsequent edema, ulceration, and necrosis of the mucosa; direct physical damage to the GI mucosa by foreign bodies (especially linear foreign bodies) can result in ulceration and possible perforation of the intestinal wall. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/ immune\u2014sepsis secondary to necrosis and/or bacterial translocation.

Because this can only be diagnosed from a renal biopsy, many noninflammatory conditions (glomerulosclerosis, amyloidosis, etc.) may be incorrectly labeled GN in patients who have not undergone evaluation via renal histology. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Circulating antigen\u2013antibody complexes become entrapped or antibodies can attach in situ to glomerular antigens or soluble antigens entrapped within the glomerular basement membrane; complement component C3 and/ or immunoglobulins (Ig) G, M, or A may be involved in complexes, which alter glomerular permeability and induce inflammation, causing proteinuria, nephron injury, fibrosis, and progressive loss of renal function. \u2022 ICGN has several different morphologies depending on the location of immunecomplex deposition as well as the glomerular response to injury; membranoproliferative, membranous nephropathy, proliferative, IgA nephropathy, and minimal change disease are recognized ICGN in small animals. \u2022 Inflammation and altered glomerular permeability result in proteinuria; subsequent oxidative damage and tubular obstruction cause renal injury, progressive nephron loss, and decreased glomerular filtration; azotemia and uremia may ensue. \u2022 Hypercoagulability, hypoalbuminemia, and hypertension (HTN) are common complications. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014proteinuria is the initial symptom; both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may occur secondarily. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014HTN is common; ascites and edema occur in nephrotic syndrome (NS); hypercoagulability and thromboembolism (TE). \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014hypercholesterolemia in NS. GENETICS Many breeds have inheritable glomerular disease leading to protein-losing nephropathy (PLN). Most are non-ICGN; however, several breeds are more frequently affected by GN (see below). INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Glomerular disease is present in most patients with kidney disease; however, not all are ICGN. Approximately 50% of dogs and cats that have undergone renal biopsy have ICGN. GN may be clinically silent and undiagnosed in many patients. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide SIGNALMENT \u2022 Species\u2014dog and cat. \u2022 Breed predilections\u2014American foxhound, Bernese mountain dog, Doberman pinscher, German shepherd, golden retriever, greyhound, Labrador retriever, Shetland sheepdog, and soft-coated wheaten terrier. \u2022 Mean age and range\u2014middle age (4\u20138 years), although may occur at any time; cats often younger\u2014mean 4 years. \u2022 Predominant sex\u2014dogs: none; cats: majority are male. SIGNS \u2022 Proteinuria caused by albuminuria is hallmark. \u2022 Historical findings\u2014nonspecific and include weight loss, muscle wasting, decreased appetite, lethargy, vomiting, and polyuria/polydipsia. \u2022 Physical examination findings\u2014may be normal; subcutaneous edema, peritoneal and/ or pleural effusion seen in NS; acute dyspnea and hypoxia may be present in pulmonary TE. CAUSES \u2022 Most patients have ICGN secondary to systemic infection or inflammation; many patients will not have an obvious trigger identified. * Infectious causes include rickettsial infection ( Borrelia , Ehrlichia , Anaplasma , Rocky Mountain spotted fever), babesiosis, bartonellosis, leishmaniasis, brucellosis, dirofilariasis, leptospirosis, systemic fungal infections, and hepatozoonosis. \u2022 Inflammatory conditions include pancreatitis, polyarthritis, pyometra, and systemic lupus erythematosus; reactions to sulfonamides and vaccines is possible; paraneoplastic GN is uncommon. RISK FACTORS Lyme-associated GN is a severe and progressive form of ICGN found in dogs with positive Borrelia serology, but causation unknown. Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, and several other breeds are more at risk.", "Glucagonoma": " \u2022 Glucagonoma is an uncommon pancreatic islet cell tumor originating from alpha cells, which secrete glucagon. They occasionally arise in extra-pancreatic locations (i.e., liver). Glucagonomas may secrete other hormones, such as gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and (rarely) insulin. \u2022 Excess circulating glucagon activates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycogenesis. This increases protein catabolism and lipolysis. Glucagon excess can inhibit erythropoiesis. The culmination of these biochemical changes results in hyperglycemia and occasionally diabetes mellitus (DM), hypoaminoacidemia, anemia, and weight loss. Glucagon can exert a secretory effect on the small intestine, leading to diarrhea. \u2022 Glucagonomas may cause an overall decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations, with epidermal protein depletion in the skin, leading to the classic dermatopathy associated with glucagonoma (necrolytic migratory erythema [NME]). \u2022 Glucagonomas can affect numerous organ systems, including musculoskeletal, integumentary, endocrine, gastrointestinal, nervous/ behavioral, and hepatobiliary. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog\u2014rare; older animals. \u2022 Cat\u2014rare. SIGNS \u2022 The hallmark sign is NME, although this may be caused by glucagonoma or hepatocutaneous syndrome. NME has also been described in veterinary medicine as metabolic epidermal necrosis and superficial necrolytic dermatitis. \u2022 Skin lesions include erythema, erosions, and crusting, generally located around mucocutaneous junctions (perineum, face, and genitalia), distal extremities, and foot pads. Lesions are often pruritic with hyperkeratotic and painful footpads. In many cases, footpads are the only affected area. \u2022 Other systemic signs include lethargy, polyuria, polydipsia, diarrhea, secondary pyoderma or yeast infection, anorexia, and weight loss. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Component of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.", "Glucosuria": " Glucosuria is detected via routine laboratory testing, most commonly with reagent test strips. Persistent glucosuria is an abnormal finding. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Glucose is a small molecule that is freely filtered through the glomerulus into the ultrafiltrate. \u2022 Glucose is actively reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubule by a sodium\u2013 glucose co-transport system. Physiologic levels of filtered glucose are mostly reabsorbed, leaving excreted levels too low to detect using screening tests. Hyperglycemic Glucosuria \u2022 Glucosuria will be present when blood glucose concentration exceeds renal tubular epithelial transport maximum. This varies by species, with dogs typically above 180 mg/dL and cats typically above 280 mg/dL. \u2022 If hyperglycemia is present, determine whether glucosuria transient or persistent. Transient \u2022 Physiologic\u2014usually transient and associated with release of endogenous \u201cstress\u201d hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, corticosteroids); especially common in cats. Serum may be normoglycemic or hyperglycemic at urine collection because different concentrations of glucose excreted in urine over time equilibrate in bladder. \u2022 Pharmacologic\u2014may occur following administration of glucose-containing solutions (e.g., dextrose); administration of drugs (glucocorticoids, growth hormone, thiazide diuretics, morphine, epinephrine) may also result in hyperglycemia and glucosuria. \u2022 Toxic\u2014ethylene glycol. \u2022 Pathologic\u2014possible with acute pancreatitis. Persistent Pathologic conditions that can result in persistent glucosuria (due to hyperglycemia) include diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, acromegaly, extreme stress, hyperthyroidism in cats. Normoglycemic Glucosuria Impaired renal proximal tubular epithelial cell reabsorptive capacity. Congenital Primary glucosuria\u2014Scottish terriers; Fanconi syndrome: basenji dogs; also sporadic in Norwegian elkhounds, Shetland sheepdogs, miniature schnauzers, Labrador retrievers, border terriers, whippets, Yorkshire terriers, and mixed-breed dogs; decreased reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, and phosphorus plus decreased secretion of hydrogen ions. Acquired \u2022 Fanconi syndrome due to toxicity such as heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead, mercury, copper, copper associated hepatitis) or dried chicken treats made in China, drugs (e.g., gentamicin, cephalosporins, outdated tetracycline, cisplatin, streptozotocin), chemicals (Lysol, maleic acid), other miscellaneous causes. \u2022 Acute renal failure with significant tubular lesions. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal\u2014normoglycemic patients have abnormal renal tubular epithelial cell function; dogs with Fanconi syndrome may develop metabolic acidosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with secondary multisystem involvement; glucosuria predisposes to bacterial urinary tract infection. \u2022 Endocrine\u2014hyperglycemic patients may have diabetes mellitus and/or hyperadrenocorticism. \u2022 Liver\u2014copper associated hepatitis; centrilobular hepatitis with copper accumulation. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Adult dogs and cats develop persistent hyperglycemic glucosuria due to adult-onset diabetes mellitus. \u2022 Dogs with congenital Fanconi syndrome typically develop clinical disease due to defective reabsorption of glucose and amino acids at 4\u20135 years of age; no sex predilection. \u2022 Familial renal tubular disorders have been reported (see Pathophysiology). \u2022 Primary renal glucosuria (Scottish terriers) may be recognized at early age as incidental finding. \u2022 Copper associated hepatitis with acquired Fanconi syndrome (Labrador retrievers). \u2022 Dogs (any breed or age) fed dried chicken treats made in China. SIGNS Clinical signs variable depending upon primary cause. Historical Findings \u2022 Persistent glucosuria results in polyuria (osmotic diuresis), leading to compensatory polydipsia. \u2022 Glucosuria predisposes to urinary tract infections; clinical signs associated with upper and/or lower urinary tract infection. \u2022 Breed and therapeutic history (see Pathophysiology) are important. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Patients with hyperglycemic glucosuria may exhibit systemic signs; see diabetes mellitus chapters. \u2022 Patients with normoglycemic glucosuria may have normal body functions. \u2022 Dogs with Fanconi syndrome may develop signs of metabolic acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, and CKD. CAUSES Hyperglycemic Glucosuria Transient \u2022 Physiologic\u2014stress; common in cats. \u2022 Pharmacologic\u2014see Pathophysiology. Persistent \u2022 Diabetes mellitus; insulin deficiency or resistance. \u2022 Hyperadrenocorticism; insulin resistance. \u2022 Acute pancreatitis; insulin deficiency or resistance. \u2022 Less common causes include pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperglucagonemia, hyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, and chronic liver failure (due to failure to metabolize glucagon). Normoglycemic Glucosuria Congenital \u2022 Primary renal glucosuria (Scottish terrier). \u2022 Fanconi syndrome. \u2022 Congenital diseases may be associated with renal dysfunction (Norwegian elkhound). Acquired \u2022 Acute kidney injury associated with proximal tubular dysfunction. \u2022 Fanconi syndrome. \u2022 CKD (rare). RISK FACTORS Vary with underlying causes.", "Gluten Enteropathy in Irish Setters": " A rarely confirmed, inherited, intestinal disease in which sensitivity develops to dietary gluten (present in wheat) and similar proteins present in related grains (i.e., rye and barley). In affected dogs, the enteropathy is characterized by partial villous atrophy, reduced brush border enzyme expression, lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal mucosa, and goblet cell hyperplasia; changes that are reversed by feeding a gluten-free diet. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Irish setter breed\u2014the line of affected setters originally described in the UK has been bred out. \u2022 Signs develop in young dogs, but are modulated by the age of first exposure to gluten. \u2022 Genetic transmission of gluten sensitive enteropathy is likely under the control of a single major autosomal recessive locus. \u2022 Gluten enteropathy has been suspected but not proven in other dog breeds and cats. SIGNS \u2022 Poor weight gain (or weight loss). \u2022 Poor body condition. \u2022 Mild small intestinal diarrhea that can be intermittent. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS The enteropathy and clinical signs are triggered by gluten-containing diets. Abnormal mucosal permeability precedes the development of signs, implying there is abnormal entry of gluten across the mucosal barrier. Gluten is then either directly toxic to the intestinal mucosa or induces an immunemediated reaction. An analogous condition in humans (celiac disease) is characterized by the presence of antibodies cross-reacting to gluten and tissue transglutaminase, but they have not been tested for in affected setters. These antibodies have been demonstrated in Border terriers with gluten-sensitive dyskinesia.", "Glycogen Storage Disease": " \u2022 Also known as glycogenosis\u2014rare inherited disorders of defective or deficient enzyme activity governing glycogen metabolism. \u2022 Tissue glycogen accumulation\u2014leads to organ enlargement and dysfunction; may affect liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and CNS. \u2022 Impaired hepatic glycogenolysis\u2014 leads to symptomatic hypoglycemia (neuroglycopenia). \u2022 Classification\u2014based on enzymatic defect and primary organ(s) involvement: more than 12 types in humans, 4 types in dogs (Ia, II, III, and VII), 1 type in cats (IV).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Glucocorticoids\u2014induce reversible increase in hepatocyte glycogen within 2\u20133 days; injectable or reposital drug induces most severe VH compared to PO or topical (ocular, cutaneous, aural) routes. \u2022 Cell expansion\u2014causes hepatomegaly, ballooning degeneration leads to parenchymal collapse; when severe, nodularity grossly mistaken for cirrhosis. \u2022 Variable response to glucocorticoids among dogs relates to drug type; route; dose; treatment duration; individual sensitivity\u2014 VH may follow low-dose, short-term oral treatment. \u2022 VH may reflect stress response, cytokines, or acute-phase response initiated by nonhepatic systemic disorders or neoplasia (especially lymphoma), without exogenous glucocorticoid exposure or adrenal disease. \u2022 VH common in dogs with gallbladder mucocele. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014normal hepatic function usually; severe degenerative VH can lead to hepatic dysfunction, jaundice, ascites, liver failure. \u2022 All systems affected by steroid hormones or primary systemic disease. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Dogs\u2014common, often accompanies primary necroinflammatory liver disorders. \u2022 Cats\u2014rare; liver vacuolation with triglyceride accumulation more common (see Hepatic Lipidosis). SIGNALMENT Species Dog; rarely cat. Breed Predilections Breeds predisposed to hyperadrenocorticism develop glycogen VH (e.g., miniature poodles, dachshunds, boxers, Boston terriers), Scottish terriers (sex hormone adrenal hyperplasia, hyperlipidemia), and others with hyperlipidemia (miniature schnauzers, Shetland sheepdogs) may develop mixed glycogen/lipid VH. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Middle-aged to old dogs\u2014spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism ( > 75% older than 9 years); chronic systemic inflammation or neoplasia. \u2022 Dogs of any age\u2014iatrogenic VH subsequent to glucocorticoid administration. \u2022 Young dogs or cats\u2014genetic glycogen storage disease. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Reflect glucocorticoids or underlying systemic illness. \u2022 Rarely, signs of hepatic disease or failure; hepatic failure can develop with severe chronic VH. \u2022 Hepatic encephalopathy observed in some dogs with hepatocutaneous syndrome. Historical Findings \u2022 Glucocorticoid excess\u2014polyuria and polydipsia; polyphagia; endocrine alopecia; abdominal distention: weak muscles, loss of elasticity; skeletal muscle weakness; excessive panting; lethargy; friable skin; bruising tendencies; urinary tract infections, may be asymptomatic; corneal ulcer. \u2022 Adrenal sex hormone hyperplasia\u2014may display some signs of glucocorticoid excess but often fewer and less severe; endocrine alopecia may be only sign; some dogs remain asymptomatic except for chronic progressive marked ALP activity and degenerative VH. \u2022 Other causes\u2014depend on system affected; chronic phenobarbital may cause severe VH. \u2022 Sex hormone hyperplasia causing VH may increase risk for dysplastic hepatic foci and hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g., Scottish terriers). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Hepatomegaly. \u2022 Relate to steroid hormone excess or underlying disease; depend on severity and duration. CAUSES \u2022 Glucocorticoid administration. \u2022 Typical hyperadrenocorticism (spontaneous). \u2022 Atypical adrenal hyperplasia\u2014overproduction of cortisol precursor sex hormones (spontaneous). \u2022 Systemic disease provoking acute-phase response or stress\u2014e.g., severe dental disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatitis, systemic neoplasia (especially lymphoma), chronic infections (urinary tract, skin), hypothyroidism, many others. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids. \u2022 Breeds at risk for hyperadrenocorticism. \u2022 Breeds at risk for hyperlipidemia\u2014often also demonstrate combined glycogen VH: miniature schnauzers, Shetland sheepdogs, beagles. \u2022 Dogs receiving chronic phenobarbital.", "Grape and Raisin Toxicosis": " Syndrome resulting from ingestion of grapes, raisins, sultanas, or Zante currants ( Vitis vinifera ). SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs are the only species in which toxicosis has been well described. \u2022 No breed, sex, or age predisposition noted. \u2022 Anecdotal reports of toxicosis in cats and ferrets exist, but data are lacking to confirm. SIGNS \u2022 Vomiting within 24 hours of ingestion; vomitus frequently contains ingested fruit. \u2022 Diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, and abdominal pain may occur; stools may contain ingested fruit. \u2022 Within 24 hours to several days, dehydration with oliguria or anuria occurs. \u2022 Death due to anuric renal failure or euthanasia. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Although amounts of raisins and grapes reported to cause toxicosis lie in the range 2.8\u20139.6 g/kg and 11\u201331 g/kg, respectively, a minimum toxic dose has not been established. Additionally, not all exposures of dogs to Vitis vinifera have resulted in clinical evidence of renal injury. \u2022 Ingestion of sultanas, Zante currants, and other varieties of Vitis vinifera has also been associated with renal injury in dogs, but amounts associated with toxicosis have not been reported. \u2022 Mechanism of toxicity and toxic principle are unknown. Inconsistent development of clinical signs resulting from ingestion of Vitis vinifera may reflect idiosyncratic reactions of individual dogs or a toxic principle that is of variable presence in the fruit due to variances in growing conditions. \u2022 Until further toxicity data are available, all exposures of dogs to Vitis vinifera should merit veterinary attention.", "Hair Follicle Tumors": " \u2022 Five types\u2014trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma are most common types, but uncommon types include infundibular keratinizing acanthoma, tricholemmoma, and pilomatricoma; these are differentiated based on their origin: trichoepithelioma, trichoblastoma, infundibular keratinizing acanthoma, and tricholemmoma, which arise from keratinocytes in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle (\u00b1 hair matrix); and pilomatricoma, which arises from the hair matrix. \u2022 All types\u2014generally benign; a few published reports of malignant trichoepitheliomas, trichoblastomas, and pilomatricomas. \u2022 Approximately 5% of all skin tumors in dogs and 1% of all skin tumors in cats.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Unknown, some genetic predisposition.", "Halitosis": " An offensive odor emanating from the oral cavity. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The sour milk odor accompanying periodontal disease may result from bacterial populations associated with plaque, calculus, unhealthy oral cavity tissues, decomposing food particles retained within the oral cavity, and tissue necrosis. \u2022 Contrary to common belief, neither normal lung air nor stomach aroma contributes. \u2022 The most common cause is periodontal diseases caused by plaque bacteria. \u2022 A bacterial biofilm forms over a freshly cleaned and polished tooth as soon as the patient starts to salivate; bacteria attach to the pellicle within 6\u20138 hours; within days, the plaque becomes mineralized, producing calculus; as plaque ages gingival inflammation (gingivitis) may occur and progress into periodontitis (tooth support loss). Eventually the bacterial flora changes from a predominantly nonmotile Gram-positive aerobic coccoid flora to a more motile, Gramnegative anaerobic population including Prophyromonas , Bacteroides , Fusobacterium , and Actinomyces spp. \u2022 The rough surface of calculus attracts more bacteria-laden biofilm, irritating the free gingiva; as the inflammation continues, the gingival sulcus is transformed into a periodontal pocket, which accumulates food debris and bacterial breakdown products, generating oral malodor (halitosis). \u2022 The primary cause of malodor is Gramnegative anaerobic bacteria that generate volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and volatile fatty acids. \u2022 VSCs may also play a role in periodontal disease, affecting the integrity of the tissue barrier, allowing endotoxins to produce periodontal destruction, endotoxemia, and bacteremia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Gastrointestinal\u2014oral cavity. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats. Breed Predilections Small breeds and brachycephalic breeds are more prone to oral disease because the teeth are closer together, smaller animals live longer, and their owners tend to feed softer food.

RISK FACTORS Breed predisposed to urolithiasis, coagulopathy, or neoplasia.", "Hemoglobinuria and Myoglobinuria": " Hemoglobinuria\u2014presence of free hemoglobin (HGB) within urine secondary to intravascular hemolysis. Myoglobinuria\u2014presence of myoglobin (MGB) within urine secondary to myocyte injury or death. Presence of either protein causes discoloration of urine (pigmenturia) as well as positive blood result during reagent test strip analysis of urine, a semiquantitative measurement of heme. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hemoglobinuria \u2014intravascular hemolysis or destruction of RBCs within vessels releases HGB from damaged red blood cells (RBCs). HGB, if free within plasma, can cause tissue injury. Haptoglobin, protein made by the liver, acts as HGB recovery system and binds free HGB. Resulting HGB\u2013haptoglobin complexes too large to be cleared by glomerular filtration and so are removed primarily by splenic macrophages. Excessive intravascular hemolysis can saturate haptoglobin, resulting in free HGB in plasma, known as hemoglobinemia. Free HGB (4 heme-containing chains, 64,000 daltons) rapidly dissociates into unstable dimers (32,000 daltons) and passes freely through glomerular basement membrane leading to hemoglobinuria. Hemoglobinuria imparts pink, dark amber, red, or red-brown discoloration to urine. Methemoglobinemia causes analogous disease process. \u2022 Myoglobinuria \u2014MGB is single hemecontaining chain (approximately 17,500 daltons). MGB able to carry oxygen without oxidation of ferrous (Fe 2+ ) to ferric (Fe 3+ ) iron due to interaction of heme with protein portion (globin). Myocyte injury and/or death releases MGB. Unlike free HGB, MGB is freely and rapidly cleared by glomerulus given its small size and absence of carrier protein, so plasma remains colorless even in face of significant myocyte death. Myoglobinuria causes brown or red-brown discoloration to urine. \u2022 Renal tubular injury \u2014presence of excess HGB or MGB in renal tubular fluid may result in kidney injury. Within tubules, acidic environment favors HGB or MGB precipitation, cast formation, and tubular obstruction. Both HGB and MGB are endocytosed by renal tubular epithelial cells. Globin, from HGB, is degraded within the cell, while free heme is catabolized by heme oxygenase, resulting in lipid peroxidation and Fe deposition. MGB also causes lipid peroxidation, but without release of free iron (via redox cycling of heme center). Alkaline conditions reported to prevent MGB-induced lipid peroxidation by stabilizing reactive ferryl MGB complex and also decreasing MGB precipitation in renal tubules. Free HGB also scavenges nitric oxide, leading to vasoconstriction of afferent renal arteriole and secondary hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Renal/urologic\u2014HGB, methemoglobin, and MGB can result in tubular injury, especially with concurrent decreased renal perfusion and acidic conditions.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Malformations impairing intrahepatic portal venous perfusion reduce hepatocyte exposure to splanchnic-derived hepatotropic factors\u2014this leads to lobular atrophy and impairs expedient hepatocyte extraction of bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation. \u2022 Compensatory hepatic arterial buffer response maintains liver viability. \u2022 Absence of macroscopic portosystemic shunting explains absence of clinical signs\u2014 there is no hepatic encephalopathy (HE) or ammonium biurate uroliths or crystalluria in dogs with MVD. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Usually asymptomatic. \u2022 May observe slow recovery from sedatives or anesthetics requiring first-pass hepatic extraction and apparent adverse drug reactions with other medications undergoing first-pass hepatic extraction or hepatic metabolism. \u2022 If concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\u2014vacillating signs include vomiting, diarrhea, inappetence, increased liver enzymes (often alanine aminotransferase [ALT]).

Most of these histiocytic diseases are of dendritic cell lineage and in dogs include cutaneous histiocytoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), reactive histiocytoses (cutaneous histiocytosis [CH] and systemic histiocytosis [SH]), and histiocytic sarcoma (HS) complex, with hemophagocytic HS representing the only macrophage-derived disease entity. In cats, histiocytic diseases are limited to feline progressive histiocytosis (FPH), HS, and feline pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (FPLCH). All of these disorders represent neoplastic processes, except for the canine reactive histiocytoses, which are inflammatory diseases associated with underlying immune dysregulation. SIGNALMENT Canine Cutaneous Histiocytoma \u2022 Most common in young dogs; 50% of affected patients < 2\u20133 years of age. \u2022 Occurs in all breeds; predisposition in purebred dogs, particularly boxers and dachshunds, cocker spaniels, Great Danes, and bobtails.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS See Table 1.", "Housesoiling\u2014Cats": " \u2022 Deposition of urine or feces outside the litter box. \u2022 Urine housesoiling (also called periuria) includes toileting, a behavior in which urine is found on horizontal surfaces outside the litter box, and urine marking, in which urine is sprayed on vertical (occasionally horizontal) surfaces as part of a ritualistic tail-up display. \u2022 Fecal housesoiling includes both toileting, a behavior characterized by feces deposited outside the litter box, and fecal marking, called middening, characterized by feces deposited in prominent locations. \u2022 Marking behavior serves a normal communicative function in cats, particularly in response to other cats inside or outside the home. \u2022 Housesoiling will negatively impact the human\u2013animal bond and can lead to relegation outside, rehoming, relinquishment, or euthanasia. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Toileting\u2014may be dissatisfaction with the litter box environment or preference for an alternative location or substrate, or may reflect an underlying pathophysiologic state such as a negative (pain) association with the litter box secondary to feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) or feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), uroliths, constipation, or orthopedic pain. \u2022 Urine marking\u2014a normal behavior observed in free-ranging and confined cats; significant individual differences exist in the propensity to urine mark in a given environment. Cat density is correlated to probability of urine marking. Cats who urine mark also commonly use a litter box for toileting (both urine and feces). \u2022 Fecal marking (middening) is rarely observed; it should be a diagnosis of exclusion. \u2022 Social or environmental stressors may contribute to housesoiling, primarily marking. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral. \u2022 Endocrine. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI). \u2022 Neurologic/musculoskeletal. \u2022 Renal/urologic. GENETICS \u2022 Not specifically identified. \u2022 Persians and Himalayans who exhibit toileting should be DNA tested for the genetic disorder polycystic kidney disease. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Housesoiling is the most common behavioral problem for which cat owners seek veterinary advice and the second most common reason for relinquishment of cats to animal shelters. \u2022 Toileting\u2014in one survey, 11% of indoor cat owners reported toileting outside the litter box as a problem. \u2022 Urine marking\u2014exhibited by approximately 10% of castrated male and 5% of ovariectomized female house cats. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Housesoiling may be more problematic where cats are restricted indoors. SIGNALMENT Species Cat Breed Predilections Housesoiling may occur in any breed, although Persians, Himalayans, and relatives are overrepresented in some studies. Mean Age and Range Toileting can occur at any age. Marking behaviors are typically seen in cats > 6 months. Predominant Sex \u2022 Housesoiling can occur in either sex, intact or altered. \u2022 Urine marking is more common in males (intact and neutered) than females (intact and neutered). SIGNS General Comments Identify the Affected Cat in a Multicat Household \u2022 Direct observation\u2014although if punished, cats may become secretive. \u2022 Videotaping or video monitoring. \u2022 Separate the cats to identify the culprit. Note that this protocol may alter the social milieu sufficiently to inhibit toileting behavior. \u2022 Add a urine indicator. Administer the dye fluorescein (6 fluorescein test strips in a gel capsule PO or 10 mg/cat). Urine outside the litter box will fluoresce under a Wood\u2019s light for approximately 24 hours. If negative, the test can be repeated on another cat. Negative results are common in households in which the frequency of urine housesoiling is low. Fluorescein may stain fabrics. If urine PH is alkaline, urine is more likely to fluoresce. \u2022 Add a feces indicator. Small shavings of nontoxic crayons may be mixed into food, with different colors fed to each cat. Identify the Locations of Housesoiling within the House The owner should draw a diagram of the home layout, indicating the locations of urine and fecal housesoiling and locations of litter boxes. Location of housesoiling can provide insight into the type of housesoiling and etiology. Historical Findings Toileting Behavior \u2022 Abnormal pattern of urination (incontinence, polyuria, hematuria, stranguria, dysuria) suggests an underlying congenital or medical problem. \u2022 History of straining to defecate; vocalizing or running away when defecating; hard, dry, or bulky feces suggest painful defecations. \u2022 Painful elimination or increases in volume or frequency of elimination could lead to soiling, conditioned avoidance, and new location or surface preferences. \u2022 History of polydipsia, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea suggests an underlying medical etiology. Urine Marking \u2022 History of conflict, aggression, or avoidance behavior between cats in a multicat household. \u2022 Observation of the posture of spraying urine\u2014the cat orients caudally to a vertical surface, stiffens its posture, raises and quivers its tail, and directs a small burst of urine caudally. \u2022 Observation of urine marks on vertical surfaces or puddled at the bottom of a wall. \u2022 Urine marks can be found on prominent furniture or other objects, or on new objects brought into the house. \u2022 Horizontal urine marks may be found on clothing or bedding associated with a particular person, cat, or dog, or in response to visitors or novel objects. Fecal Marking Feces deposited on prominent, conspicuous locations. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 If strictly behavioral, physical examination will be normal. \u2022 Apparently neutered males that urine mark should be examined for the presence of penile spines, indicating the presence of endogenous testosterone, or quantify serum testosterone. CAUSES Medical Causes \u2022 Any metabolic or GI condition that causes polyuria (e.g. diabetes mellitus), diarrhea, or constipation. \u2022 Lower urinary tract disease including interstitial cystitis (may be associated with environmental stressors). \u2022 Urolithiasis. \u2022 Hyperthyroidism. \u2022 Feline leukemia virus (FeLV). \u2022 Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). \u2022 Liver disease. \u2022 CNS disease/cognitive dysfunction (senility). \u2022 Iatrogenic\u2014administration of fluids, corticosteroids, diuretics, laxatives. \u2022 Musculoskeletal pain that makes entry to/ exit from the litter box or elimination  postures difficult can contribute to litter box aversion. \u2022 Hormonal influences may contribute to urine marking. Behavioral Causes Toileting Behavior \u2022 Inadequate cleaning of litter box. \u2022 Inadequate number of boxes or locations (one box per cat plus one is recommended). \u2022 Box located in remote or unpleasant surroundings or subject to interference by dogs or children. \u2022 Inappropriate type of box\u2014covered or uncovered, too small; or allows other cats, pet dogs, and young children to target the cat as it exits. \u2022 Time factors\u2014daily or weekly temporal patterns of toileting suggest an environmental cause; acute onset in a cat who has previously used the litter box suggests a medical or social problem. \u2022 Substrate\u2014unacceptable litter type; preference tests indicate that most cats prefer unscented, fine-grained (clumping) litter, but individual variability; coincident change in litter box habits with new litter type suggests an association; sudden shift from one substrate (e.g., litter) to an unusual substrate (e.g., porcelain sink) suggests a lower urinary tract disorder. \u2022 Location\u2014urination outside the litter box may suggest a location preference or social factors; urination in the vicinity of the litter box may suggest dissatisfaction with qualities of the litter box, including litter box hygiene. \u2022 Social dynamics\u2014consider social conflicts between cats at the time the problem started (e.g., addition of a new cat). Marking \u2022 Marking is associated with arousal, anxiety, or territorial behavior. \u2022 The probability of urine marking is directly proportional to the number of cats in the household. \u2022 Marking can be a response to household disruption or another cat(s) in or outside the home; urine marks around windows and doors to the outside suggest a response to the presence of an outdoor cat. \u2022 Urine marking grocery bags or new furniture suggests arousal in response to new stimuli. RISK FACTORS Toileting \u2022 Inadequate litter box hygiene. \u2022 Litter box features (litter type or scent, box size or style).

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None described. SIGNALMENT Species Dog Breed Predilections Potential genetic breed predisposition for ease of housetraining and submissive or  excitement urination. Dogs obtained from a commercial breeding establishment are more likely to urinate vertically or submissively urinate than those obtained from a noncommercial breeder. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Inappropriate elimination due to improper or incomplete housetraining, primarily in younger dogs. \u2022 Submissive and excitement urination, primarily in younger dogs. \u2022 Urine marking begins as the dog reaches sexual maturity. \u2022 Housesoiling is a common complaint from owners of elderly dogs. Predominant Sex The incidence of inappropriate elimination, including marking, in intact male dogs is almost 60% higher than in castrated male dogs and intact or spayed female dogs. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Inappropriate elimination is the most common individual reason for shelter relinquishment. \u2022 Proper housetraining must be discussed with clients. \u2022 Housesoiling can be associated with medical problems. Historical Findings \u2022 History of urination and/or defecation in inappropriate areas. \u2022 May be associated with signs of other behavioral disorders (such as separation anxiety). \u2022 May be associated with lack of time or knowledge to properly housetrain. \u2022 May be associated with punishment. \u2022 A complete history will help determine potential triggers, including when, where, and how frequently the elimination occurs, and reliability of outdoor elimination training. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 If examination findings and laboratory results are normal, housesoiling is more likely due to a behavioral cause. \u2022 There may have been an inciting medical cause that has been resolved but the animal continues to eliminate inappropriately. CAUSES Canine inappropriate elimination can be due to a primary behavioral problem or secondary to/concurrent with a medical disorder.

In the male, estrogens potentiate the action of androgens in the prostate. Estrogens also increase osteoblastic activity, retention of calcium and phosphorus, total body protein, and metabolic rate. \u2022 High serum concentration of estrogen provides a source of negative feedback in the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary axis, suppressing gonadotropin secretion, and interferes with stem cell differentiation in the bone marrow and erythrocyte iron metabolism.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hypermagnesemia is less clinically significant than low total body magnesium in veterinary patients. \u2022 Magnesium is second only to potassium as the most abundant intracellular cation. Found primarily in bone and muscle, it is required for many metabolic functions. \u2022 Serum magnesium is present in three forms\u2014protein-bound form (approximately 25\u201330%) and chelated and ionized forms (together account for 70\u201375%). \u2022 Magnesium absorption occurs primarily in the ileum, but also in the jejunum and colon. \u2022 Magnesium is an important cofactor in the sodium-potassium ATPase pump that maintains electrical gradients across membranes. \u2022 Interference with the electrical gradient can change resting membrane potentials; repolarization disturbances result in neuromuscular and cardiac abnormalities. \u2022 The kidneys maintain magnesium balance with 10\u201315% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, 60\u201370% in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and 10\u201315% reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule. Reabsorption within the distal convoluted tubule is under hormonal and neurohormonal control and determines the final urine concentration of magnesium. \u2022 Any condition that severely lowers the glomerular filtration rate can elicit hypermagnesemia because magnesium homeostasis is largely controlled by renal elimination. \u2022 Clinically significant hypermagnesemia is more commonly associated with acute kidney injury, and the degree of hypermagnesemia is proportional to the severity of renal failure. \u2022 Exuberant supplementation of magnesium can lead to iatrogenic hypermagnesemia, especially in patients with decreased renal function. \u2022 High magnesium concentration impairs transmission of nerve impulses and decreases postsynaptic responses at the neuromuscular junction. When magnesium was given to anesthetized dogs at 0.12 mEq/kg/min, cardiovascular effects were not noted until plasma levels exceeded 12.2 mEq/L. The total dose of magnesium required to reach that level was 1\u20132 mEq/kg. It took cumulative doses of 5.9\u201310.9 mEq/kg to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation). \u2022 Magnesium has been called nature\u2019s calcium blocker; the most serious complications of hypermagnesemia result from calcium antagonism in the cardiac conduction system. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular. \u2022 Musculoskeletal. \u2022 Nervous. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Increased plasma ionized magnesium concentration was found in 2% of 9,950 canine submissions to a clinical laboratory. In that study, 40% of the cases were caused by azotemia, 19% were iatrogenic, 11% had tissue damage, and 6% had endocrine disease. In another study, hypermagnesemia was found in 18% of hospitalized cats and 13% of hospitalized dogs. Most of these patients also had renal insufficiency or postrenal azotemia.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The cerebellum plays a central role in generating skilled movements and maintaining muscle tone and body posture; it does not initiate but coordinates and smoothes movements. \u2022 Damage to the cerebellum results in inaccurate gauging of voluntary movements; motor strength is preserved; conscious proprioception is unaffected. \u2022 Rarely, compression of the spinocerebellar tracts in spinal cord disorders can produce dysmetria; this is more likely to occur with dorsally located lesions. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nervous system. GENETICS \u2022 The hereditary ataxias are an important group of diseases in which cerebellar degenerations causes dysmetria and hypermetria in dogs. \u2022 The majority of breed-related hereditary ataxias are autosomal recessive, highly penetrant traits. \u2022 An X\u2013linked hereditary ataxia has been described in pointers. \u2022 Lysosomal storage diseases are genetic disorders, typically autosomal recessive in both dogs and cats. \u2022 Immune-mediated encephalitis likely has a hereditary component\u2014the mode of inheritance has not been described but is complex.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Na + is the most abundant cation in the extracellular fluid, so hypernatremia usually results in hyperosmolality. \u2022 Hypernatremia can be caused by excessive free water loss, increased intake of Na + , or a combination of both. \u2022 Common causes of hypernatremia include renal or gastrointestinal loss of water in excess of sodium loss and low water intake. Excessive Na + ingestion is a rare cause. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic. \u2022 Nervous. SIGNALMENT Dog and cat.

CAUSES \u2022 Free water deficit (most common cause)\u2014 low water intake (e.g., no access to water, adipsia, or hypodipsia); high urinary water loss; high insensible water loss (e.g., panting, hyperthermia). \u25e6 Urinary loss (e.g., diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, osmotic diuresis, diuresis after acute urinary obstruction). \u25e6 Gastrointestinal sodium loss (e.g., administration of osmotic cathartic, vomiting, diarrhea). \u25e6 A wide variety of drugs interfere with renal capacity to concentrate urine, leading to water loss in excess of Na + ; these drugs include lithium, demeclocycline, and amphotericin. \u2022 Oral sodium ingestion (rare); IV administration of 0.9% or 7% NaCl; hyperaldosteronism (rarely hypernatremic); hyperadrenocorticism (mild).", "Hyperosmolarity": " \u2022 Osmolarity\u2014mOsm/L: the number of solute particles per liter of solution. \u2022 Osmolality\u2014mOsm/kg: the number of solute particles per kilogram of solution. \u2022 Hyperosmolarity\u2014a high concentration of solute particles per liter of solution. \u2022 Serum concentrations > 310 mOsm/L in dogs and > 330 mOsm/L in cats are considered hyperosmolar. \u2022 Morbidity from hyperosmolarity is related more to rapid changes in osmolarity than to the actual amount of change. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Serum sodium is responsible for most of the osmotically active particles that contribute to serum osmolarity; serum glucose and urea also contribute. \u2022 Anything that causes free water loss increases concentrations of solutes in plasma or serum, thereby increasing serum osmolarity. \u2022 Blood volume, hydration status, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) are intimately involved in controlling extracellular fluid volume. \u2022 Low circulating blood volume and low blood pressure stimulates carotid and aortic baroreceptors to cause ADH secretion. \u2022 Hyperosmolarity affects the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus and stimulates ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary; the hypothalamic thirst center is also stimulated and causes an increase in water consumption. \u2022 Rapid increases in serum osmolarity cause water movement along its concentration gradient from intracellular to extracellular spaces, resulting in neuronal dehydration, cell shrinkage, and cell death; cerebral vessels may weaken and hemorrhage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hypovolemia, hypotension, decreased ventricular contractility. \u2022 Nervous\u2014excessive thirst may be the first sign of hyperosmolarity.

SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Hypodipsia and hyperosmolarity have been reported in young female miniature schnauzers. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Primarily neurologic or behavioral. \u2022 Severity is related more to how quickly hyperosmolarity occurs than to the absolute magnitude of change. \u2022 Clinical signs most likely if serum osmolarity is > 350 mOsm/L and severe if > 375 mOsm/L. Historical Findings Anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, weakness, disorientation, ataxia, seizures, and coma; polydipsia followed by hypodipsia.

BP increases may be transient and related to the measurement process (situational or \u201cwhite-coat\u201d hypertension), or sustained and pathologic. In veterinary patients, systemic arterial hypertension (HT) usually occurs in association with a clinical disease or treatment known to cause HT and is categorized as secondary. If an underlying disease is not present or able to be determined, HT is considered idiopathic. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 BP is the force exerted by a blood column against the vessel wall, and is determined by cardiac output, aortic impedance and systemic vascular resistance. \u2022 Normally, BP is under close regulation, such that rapid or wide swings are avoided. \u2022 Factors that favor BP increases by augmenting cardiac output (e.g., increases in intravascular volume, heart rate, or myocardial contractility) or systemic vascular resistance (e.g., arteriolar vasoconstriction, increased blood viscosity) are usually balanced by autonomic, renal, and local vascular responses that restore normal BP. \u2022 Systemic HT may develop in association with diseases or pharmacologic agents that overwhelm or interfere with normal homeostatic mechanisms or with vascular responsiveness to these mechanisms. \u2022 Chronic, sustained BP increases may cause injury to several organs, referred to as target organ damage (TOD).

SYSTEMS AFFECTED Ophthalmic INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Not uncommon ophthalmic finding and one that is important to recognize, as it may be the presenting clinical sign for serious underlying systemic disease. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Collies with collie eye anomaly. SIGNS Historical Findings\u2014Primary Ophthalmic Causes \u2022 Usually a unilateral presentation in an otherwise systemically normal patient. \u2022 Blunt globe trauma will often have a compatible history. \u2022 Corneal perforation may have a history of a corneal ulcer, or preceding encounter with a cat resulting in a cat claw laceration, especially in puppies. Historical Findings\u2014Systemic Causes \u2022 Unilateral or bilateral presentation; bilateral presentation is strongly supportive of systemic etiology. \u2022 Weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, decreased vision, or loss of vision may accompany some systemic causes. \u2022 Ocular pain usually accompanies infectious and neoplastic causes due to accompanying uveitis. Physical Examination Findings\u2014Primary Ophthalmic Causes \u2022 Except in cases of generalized trauma, the physical exam will be unremarkable with abnormalities restricted to the globe and periorbital soft tissues. \u2022 Blunt trauma patients will have painful periorbital soft tissue swelling and uncommonly orbital rim fractures; there is often total hyphema obscuring other intraocular structures. \u2022 Perforating trauma is associated with severe pain, a bloody or clear (aqueous) ocular discharge, varying degrees of hyphema, miosis, and anterior synechia, and a shallow anterior chamber; corneal edema will surround the perforation site and an iris prolapse may be present through the perforation. \u2022 Hyphema due to PIFMs, retinal detachment, neoplasia, or congenital vasculature is usually nonpainful with very little intraocular inflammation (absent aqueous flare, miosis). \u2022 Hypermature cataract supports the development of either PIFM or retinal detachment as a cause of hyphema. Physical Examination Findings\u2014 Systemic Disease Causes \u2022 Ophthalmic examination findings will vary depending on the etiology of the hyphema. \u2022 When an underlying systemic disease is suspected, a thorough physical exam is warranted; the exam may be unremarkable or have significant findings such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or petechiae. \u2022 Hyphema due to noninflammatory etiologies such as hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathies will usually manifest minimal discomfort and uveitis (trace or no aqueous flare, no miosis, no conjunctival hyperemia); hypertension is almost always associated with retinal involvement such as retinal hemorrhages and/or retinal detachment. \u2022 Patients with coagulopathies may have bleeding elsewhere, including the subconjunctival tissue and retrobulbar space; thrombocytopenia may create petechia on the palpebral or nictitans conjunctiva. \u2022 Infectious and neoplastic etiologies often cause significant pain, anterior uveitis (miosis, aqueous flare, fibrin, iridal hyperemia and swelling), chorioretinitis with retinal detachment, and possible secondary glaucoma.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency results in a diminished ability to excrete potassium and retain sodium, disrupting sodium and potassium balance in the body. \u2022 Sodium loss leads to diminished effective circulating volume; this contributes to pathophysiologic changes and clinical abnormalities, including prerenal azotemia, hypotension, dehydration, weakness, and depression. \u2022 Hyperkalemia can result in weakness, lethargy, and anorexia; it may result in bradyarryhthmias. \u2022 Glucocorticoid (cortisol) deficiency contributes to anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, lethargy, and weight loss; due to its role in glucose homeostasis, hypocortisolemia predisposes to hypoglycemia.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Potassium is primarily an intracellular electrolyte (98% of total body potassium is intracellular); serum levels, however, may not accurately reflect total body stores. \u2022 It is predominantly responsible for the maintenance of intracellular fluid volume and required for normal function of many enzymes. \u2022 Resting cellular membrane potential is determined by the ratio of intracellular to extracellular potassium concentration and maintained by the Na + /K + \u2013adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) pump. Conduction disturbances in susceptible tissues (cardiac, nerve, muscle) are caused by rapid shifts in this ratio causing myoneural membrane hyperpolarization. \u2022 Hypokalemia can be caused by decreased intake, loss (via the gastrointestinal tract or kidneys), or translocation of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid space.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation, found primarily in bone (60%) and soft tissues (38%). \u2022 Hypomagnesemia has many causes; incidence rates > 50% have been reported in critically ill humans. \u2022 Serum magnesium is present in three forms\u2014protein-bound form (approximately 25\u201330%) and chelated and ionized forms (together 70\u201375%). \u2022 Serum magnesium concentration does not always reflect whole-body magnesium status. \u2022 Magnesium absorption occurs primarily in the ileum as well as the jejunum and colon. \u2022 Kidneys maintain magnesium balance, with 10\u201315% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, 60\u201370% in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and 10\u201315% reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule. Reabsorption within the distal convoluted tubule is under hormonal and neurohormonal control and determines the final urine concentration of magnesium. \u2022 Magnesium is an important cofactor in the sodium\u2013potassium adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) pump that maintains a membrane electrical gradient. Magnesium is also important in the production and elimination of acetylcholine; hypomagnesemia can increase acetyl - choline at motor endplates and cause tetany. \u2022 Interference with membrane potentials can result in neuromuscular and cardiac abnormalities. \u2022 Magnesium regulates calcium movement into smooth muscle cells and is important for cardiac contractile strength, conduction, and peripheral vascular tone. \u2022 Hypomagnesemia alters function of skeletal muscle, resulting in tetany and myopathies. \u2022 Magnesium depletion affects membrane pumps on cardiac cells, resulting in depolarization and tachyarrhythmias; cardiac arrhythmias associated with hypomagnesemia include ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes, QT prolongation, ST segment shortening, and widening of T waves; hypomagnesemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity because both inhibit the membrane pump. \u2022 Hypomagnesemia causes resistance to the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and can increase the uptake of calcium into bone.

Hypomagnesemia is found in 32% of dogs and 85% of cats with hypoparathyroidism, and can be seen following surgical parathyroidectomy. \u2022 Lactation, pancreatitis, insulin administration, and catecholamine excess can cause excessive magnesium loss. \u2022 Magnesium can be redistributed by refeeding after starvation and insulin therapy in diabetic patients. \u2022 Causes of hypomagnesemia in the critically ill include decreased intake, lack of magnesium in parenteral fluids (longterm fluid therapy or hemodialysis), use of a total parenteral nutrition formulation with inadequate magnesium content, excessive gastrointestinal loss, redistribution, and sequestration. \u2022 Hypomagnesemia is associated with diabetes mellitus in humans, with nearly 25% of human diabetic outpatients having low serum magnesium, and may occur during therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis in dogs and cats.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Sodium is the most abundant cation in the extracellular fluid. Hyponatremia usually reflects hypo-osmolality and is typically associated with a decreased total body sodium content. Either water retention or solute loss can cause hyponatremia. Most solute loss occurs in iso-osmotic solutions (e.g., vomit and diarrhea) and, as a result, water retention in relation to solute is the underlying cause in almost all patients with hyponatremia. In general, hyponatremia occurs only when a defect in renal water excretion is present. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous\u2014severe neurologic dysfunction is not usually seen until serum sodium concentration falls below 110\u2013115 mEq/L.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Control of phosphorus is influenced by the actions and interactions of PTH and vitamin D with the gastrointestinal tract, bone, kidneys, and parathyroid glands. \u2022 Decreased serum phosphorus concentration can be caused by translocation of phosphorus from the extracellular fluid into cells, decreased renal reabsorption, or decreased intestinal absorption of phosphorus. \u2022 Low serum phosphorus can lead to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, which affects cells with high ATP energy demands (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, nerve tissue, and red blood cells). \u2022 Many important enzyme systems are dependent on adequate phosphorus levels, including glycolysis, ammoniagenesis, 1-hydroxylation of 25(OH)-cholecalciferol, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which are essential for energy production, acid excretion, calcium balance, and tissue oxygenation, respectively. \u2022 Phosphorus is also required for maintenance of cell membrane integrity, playing an essential role in the production of ATP, guanosine triphosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and phospho - creatinine. \u2022 Diabetic (ketototic and nonketotic) patients are at increased risk for hypophosphatemia due to depleted phosphorus stores, lost muscle mass, and urinary losses.

In primary hypothermia, the healthy individual\u2019s compensatory responses to heat loss are overwhelmed by exposure, whereas secondary hypothermia complicates many systemic diseases. \u2022 Stage I\u201490\u201395 \u00b0F (32\u201335 \u00b0C). \u2022 Stage II\u201482\u201390 \u00b0F (28\u201332 \u00b0C). \u2022 Stage III\u201475\u201382 \u00b0F (24\u201328 \u00b0C). \u2022 Stage IV\u2014 < 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Normal thermoregulation balances heat gained or lost to the environment with heat produced via central thermogenesis; it is controlled by the hypothalamus with input from thermoreceptors; heat can be gained or lost to the environment via four mechanisms: evaporation, radiation, convection, and conduction; central thermogenesis generates heat via basal metabolism, muscle activity, and uncoupling of brown fat (neonates). \u2022 Heat production can be augmented via shivering and increased basal metabolic rate; activation of both sympathetic nervous and endocrine systems results in increased circulating levels of thyroid-releasing hormone, catecholamines, growth hormone, and glucocorticoids, which all contribute to increased glucose utilization and basal metabolic rate. \u2022 Adaptations to minimize heat loss include cutaneous vasoconstriction, piloerection, and behavioral responses such as curling up, sharing body heat, and seeking shelter. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014in mild hypothermia, sympathetic stimulation induces tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction with normal or elevated cardiac output (CO) and BP; as the patient becomes colder, cardiac pacemaker cell depolarization is slowed, resulting in bradycardia resistant to treatment with atropine; the resultant fall in CO is balanced by increased systemic vascular resistance; at lower temperatures, bradycardia becomes progressively extreme and systemic vascular resistance falls as catecholamine release and adrenergic receptor responsiveness are blunted. \u2022 Endocrine\u2014sympathetic activation and release of counter-regulatory hormones trigger increased glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis as well as inhibit the release and uptake of insulin resulting in hyperglycemia; when hypothermia develops slowly or is longlasting, glycogen stores become depleted and hypoglycemia develops. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014 increased gastric acid production and reduced duodenal bicarbonate secretion may predispose to gastrointestinal ulceration; ileus is common. \u2022 Hemic\u2014plasma shifts and consequent hemoconcentration may lead to hyper- and hypocoagulopathy; depressed enzymatic activity of clotting factors and platelet hyporeactivity may exacerbate hypocoagulability. \u2022 Hepatobiliary/pancreatic\u2014hypoxia leads to hepatocellular damage and pancreatitis. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014increased joint fluid viscosity and muscle stiffness. \u2022 Nervous\u2014 CNS metabolism and level of consciousness decrease and nerve conduction velocity progressively slows; mild incoordination is followed by lethargy, obtundation, and coma. \u2022 Renal\u2014peripheral vasoconstriction increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate resulting in increased urine production; progressive tubular dysfunction and antidiuretic hormone resistance contribute further to cold diuresis; later, urine output decreases as result of falling CO; acute kidney injury may ensue. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014initial tachypnea replaced by decreased respiratory rate and tidal volume and increased airway secretions; as temperature falls, protective airway reflexes are reduced; below 93.2 \u00b0F (34 \u00b0C) ventilatory drive is attenuated and increased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch; progressive hypoventilation, apnea, and, more rarely, pulmonary edema may develop; hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left; this may be masked by concurrent lactic and respiratory acidosis that may become so profound the overall result is a right shift. \u2022 Skin\u2014edema secondary to increased vascular permeability.

Characterized by a generalized decrease in cellular metabolic activity. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Acquired Hypothyroidism \u2022 In dogs, acquired hypothyroidism can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. \u2022 Primary hypothyroidism is associated with a defect localized to the thyroid gland. The thyroid tissue has been destroyed or replaced and thus becomes less responsive to thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH). T 3 and T 4 levels gradually decline, with a compensatory increase in TSH. \u25e6 Lymphocytic thyroiditis is an immunemediated process characterized by chronic and progressive lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of the thyroid gland. This process is gradual and accounts for the slow onset of clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The immune-mediated process is associated with production of autoantibodies, predominantly against thyroglobulin; however, autoantibodies against T 3 and T 4 have been reported. \u25e6 Idiopathic thyroid atrophy does not demonstrate an inflammatory component and is caused by the replacement of normal thyroid tissue with adipose tissue. \u25e6 Together, these processes account for 95% of the clinical cases of hypothyroidism in dogs; each accounts for 50% of reported cases. \u25e6 Rare causes of primary hypothyroidism include neoplastic destruction of thyroid tissue, iodine deficiency, infection, and iatrogenic destruction secondary to drugs, surgery, or radioiodine treatment. \u2022 Secondary acquired hypothyroidism is rare. The defect is localized to the pituitary, where the ability to synthesize and secrete TSH is impaired. Secondary hypothyroidism may be caused by pituitary tumors, congenital malformation of the pituitary, infection, or TSH suppression. Drugs, hormones, or concurrent illness can cause TSH suppression. \u2022 Tertiary hypothyroidism (not reported in the veterinary literature) is hypothalamic in origin, and production of thyrotropinreleasing hormone (TRH) is either decreased or nonexistent. \u2022 Hypothyroidism may occur following radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy for hyperthyroidism in cats. Congenital Hypothyroidism \u2022 Congenital hypothyroidism is a rare disease that is categorized as goitrous or nongoitrous. Goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) develops when there is increased release of TSH, along with an intact thyroid TSH receptor. \u2022 An autosomal recessive form of congenital hypothyroidism has been reported in specific dog and cat breeds. Affected animals have a thyroid peroxidase deficiency. \u2022 Congenital hypothyroidism is also noted as an element of panhypopituitarism.

Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Most changes appear to be secondary to decreased metabolism due to a lack of circulating thyroid hormones. \u2022 The most common findings include dermatologic abnormalities (88% of hypothyroid dogs): \u25e6 Bilateral symmetric nonpruritic truncal alopecia; hair loss is noted in areas of increased wear and usually includes the ventral thorax and neck, ventral abdomen, elbows, and tail. Loss of primary hair is most common, with retention of guard hairs, resulting in a short, fine hair coat. \u25e6 Dry, lackluster hair coat. \u25e6 Seborrhea is common and may be localized or have a more generalized distribution pattern. \u25e6 Pyoderma is noted in 14% of hypothyroid dogs and may be recurrent in nature. Generalized demodicosis and Malassezia spp. infections are common. Though primary dermatologic conditions are nonpruritic, pruritis may accompany secondary parasitic, yeast, or bacterial infections. Chronic changes to the skin can result in thickening and hyperpigmentation. \u2022 Otitis externa. \u2022 Weight gain. \u2022 Decreased activity/lethargy. \u2022 Most neurologic signs are associated with polyneuropathy and include weakness, facial nerve paralysis, vestibular signs (usually peripheral), and hyporeflexia. No data support a direct association between megaesophagus or laryngeal paralysis and hypothyroidism. \u2022 CNS signs, including seizures, ataxia, and coma (myxedema coma), are rare. \u2022 In females, hypothyroidism is associated with increased periparturient mortality and lower birth rate in pups. In males, decreased fertility has been reported, but not confirmed, in hypothyroid dogs. \u2022 Cardiovascular abnormalities are rare.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is generally categorized by the predominant mucosal cellular infiltrate, such as lymphocytic-plasmacytic, eosinophilic, or granulomatous enteritis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Poorly understood but likely due to complex interplay between mucosal immunity and environmental factors (i.e., dietary and bacterial antigens) in genetically susceptible dogs; aberrant host immune responses are likely triggered by antigens derived from resident microbiota. \u2022 Damage results from elaboration of cytokines, release of proteolytic and lysosomal enzymes, complement activation secondary to immune complex deposition, and generation of oxygen free radicals. \u2022 Host genetic susceptibility involving defects in innate immunity is suspected in dogs, and possibly cats.

CAUSES Pathogenesis unknown but most likely multifactorial, involving complex interactions between host genetics, mucosal immunity, and environmental (diet, intestinal bacteria) factors. Infectious Agents \u2022 Adherent and invasive Escherichia coli has been associated with granulomatous colitis in dogs. \u2022 Giardia , Salmonella , Campylobacter , and resident microbiota have been implicated. Dietary Agents Meat proteins, milk proteins, gluten (wheat), and additives are all proposed causative agents, likely playing an important role. Genetic Factors \u2022 Some forms of IBD more common in certain breeds. \u2022 Defects in innate immunity (e.g., mutations in TLR2 , TLR5 , and nod2 as seen in German shepherd dogs) that perturb mucosal homeostasis may predispose individual to IBD.

Although the viruses originated in other species, the H3 viruses are considered \u201ccanine influenza viruses\u201d as they are now transmissible dog to dog. Influenza H7N2 is an avian influenza A virus that was documented in shelter cats. H1N1 human pandemic influenza is also capable of infecting dogs and cats, but there is no evidence of transmission. \u2022 Natural route of infection is airborne particles or oral contact with contaminated surfaces. Replication of the virus appears to be restricted to epithelial cells of the upper and lower airways, with possible involvement of alveolar macrophages. Antibody response detectable by 8 days post infection and titers remain detectable for > 1 year. Protective immune responses have not been defined. \u2022 H3N8 CIV activity was first detected in racing greyhounds in the United States in 2004 and has subsequently been identified in dogs across the country. \u2022 H3N2 CIV was detected in South Korea in 2007, but existed in China several years earlier; genetic lineage is of avian origin and probably arose in East Asia. \u2022 H3N2 CIV infection causes more severe clinical signs, is more easily transmissible, and is shed for a longer period than H3N8 CIV.

SIGNALMENT \u2022 For all reported cats with myelopathy secondary to disc disease\u2014mean age 8.4 years, range: 1.5\u201317 years. \u2022 Cats with mineralized type I disc disease\u2014mean age 7.3 years, range: 2\u201313 years. \u2022 Predominantly domestic breeds, several purebred (Oriental) breeds reported; rare exotic large cat (tiger) reported. \u2022 No sex predisposition.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Majority of cats reported had type I disc degeneration, with extrusion of mineralized nucleus pulposus into vertebral canal resulting in spinal cord trauma and compression. \u2022 Unlike dogs, where chondrodystrophic breeds (e.g., dachshunds) predisposed to type I disc disease and subsequent extrusion, no obvious risk factors apparent in cats. \u2022 Most cats reported had clinically significant disc protrusions or extrusions between T11 and S1; similar to dogs, presence of the intercapital ligament from T1 to T10 may make disc protrusions in that region less likely.", "Intervertebral Disc Disease, Cervical": " Degeneration of the cervical intervertebral discs that may result in protrusion or extrusion of disc material into the spinal canal. The protruded or extruded disc material causes spinal cord compression (myelopathy) and/or nerve root compression (radiculopathy), as well as concussive spinal cord injury in varying degrees. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Traditionally classified as acute disc herniation (Hansen type I disc) or chronic disc protrusion (Hansen type II disc); other types include extrusion of apparently healthy, hydrated nucleus pulposus with or without spinal cord compression, the latter termed acute noncompressive nucleus pulposus extrusion (ANNPE). \u2022 Hansen type I\u2014degeneration of the nucleus pulposus and acute rupture of the annulus fibrosus with extrusion of the nucleus pulposus into the spinal canal. \u2022 Hansen type II\u2014fibrinoid degeneration and protrusion of the dorsal annulus fibrosus into the vertebral canal (can involve a dynamic component). \u2022 Disc extrusion or protrusion into the spinal canal causes focal compression of the spinal cord (myelopathy) and/or focal compression of a nerve root (radiculopathy) in addition to a variable degree of contusion injury; ANNPE primarily results in a contusion injury. \u2022 Consequences of spinal cord compression are ischemia and demyelination. \u2022 Consequences of spinal cord contusion include axonal and vascular injury as well as secondary cellular injury. \u2022 Disc extrusion may be secondary to trauma, but this rarely occurs aside from those patients with hydrated disc herniations. \u2022 Surgical fusion of cervical vertebrae may alter the biomechanics of adjacent vertebral bodies and therefore predispose discs to protrusion or extrusion; this is termed the domino effect.

SIGNS \u2022 Severity of clinical signs and spinal cord injury is dependent on several factors, including the rate and volume of disc protrusion or extrusion, spinal cord diameter relative to vertebral canal diameter, and the velocity of disc material that is extruded. \u2022 Herniation in the cervical region can result in fewer neurologic deficits compared to similar lesions in the thoracolumbar region, because the spinal canal area is greater and can accommodate more disc material before spinal cord compression. Historical Findings \u2022 Neck pain\u2014most common owner complaint. \u2022 Stiff, stilted gait, lameness, or reluctance to move the head and neck. \u2022 Lowered head stance and muscle spasms of the head, neck, and shoulder. \u2022 Inability to rise or falling forward frequently. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Neck pain\u2014elicited upon slow manipulation of the neck or by deep palpation of the cervical muscles. \u2022 Apparent forelimb lameness or nerve root signature (e.g., a thoracic limb that knuckles, appears lame, or is held in partial flexion). \u2022 Paresis with or without general proprioceptive deficits involving one or both thoracic and pelvic limbs may be present. \u2022 Pelvic limb paresis may be more severe than thoracic limb paresis. \u2022 Pelvic limb spinal reflexes may be normal to exaggerated. \u2022 Thoracic limb spinal reflexes may be normal to exaggerated when lesions are located in the C1\u2013C6 spinal cord segment, and may be normal to decreased when the C6\u2013T2 spinal cord segment is affected, although this finding is not reliable in some patients. \u2022 Severity of clinical signs and degree of compression are not always correlated. \u2022 Bladder function may be upper motor neuron in nature or normal. CAUSES \u2022 Degeneration of the intervertebral disc material and subsequent herniation or protrusion. \u2022 Trauma may lead to extrusion of healthy material or otherwise degenerative material.

Intervertebral discs chronically degenerate by loss of water, cellular necrosis, and dystrophic calcification. In the chronic condition, biomechanical properties of the disc deteriorate, and subsequently protrusion (Hansen type II) or extrusion (Hansen type I) of disc material occurs. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Intervertebral disc degeneration is initiated by one or more factors including trauma, chronic overload, decreased spinal mobility, age-related deterioration in collagen and cartilage, and hypermobility. \u2022 Hansen type I refers to acute extrusion of nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosis into the vertebral canal; Hansen type I lesions typically occur in chondrodystrophic dogs, but may occur in larger nonchondrodystrophic dogs as well; onset of neurologic signs is usually acute and often severe; acute disc extrusion results in extruded material causing direct trauma to the spinal cord and residual disc mass leading to extradural spinal cord compression; trauma and spinal cord compression results in ischemia and spinal cord changes that vary from mild demyelination to necrosis of both gray and white matter; events at the cellular level include release of vasoactive substances, increased intracellular calcium, and increased free radical formation and lipid peroxides. \u2022 Hansen type II lesions involve gradual protrusion (bulging) of the dorsal annular fibers into the vertebral canal associated with fibroid degeneration of the disc; Hansen type II lesions typically occur in nonchondrodystrophic dogs; the most common case presentation is of gradual onset of neurologic dysfunction and slow progression. \u2022 Hansen type III injuries occur when the nucleus pulposus herniates with such force as to enter the spinal cord by penetration of the dura; Hansen type III injuries are rare, but carry a poor prognosis because they are commonly associated with subsequent myelomalacia and loss of deep pain response.\u2022 Affected animals exhibit pain due to dural irritation, nerve root impingement, or possibly discogenic (annular pain receptors) in origin. \u2022 Disc herniation is rare between T3 and T10 owing to the barrier of the intercapital ligament between dorsal annulus and spinal cord. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous. \u2022 Neuromuscular. \u2022 Renal/ urologic (loss of voluntary urethral sphincter control). \u2022 Digestive (loss of voluntary anal sphincter control). \u2022 Musculoskeletal (muscle atrophy in chronic disease). GENETICS Early studies suggest a polygenetic model with no dominance or sex linkage. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Most common neurologic dysfunction in small animals; affects 2% of the canine population. \u2022 Occurs less commonly in cats, but the exact incidence is unknown, and the disease is likely underdiagnosed or reported due to lack of suspicion as a differential diagnosis. \u2022 In specific breeds, such as dachshunds, affected prevalence as high as 20% has been reported. \u2022 Thoracolumbar disc disease comprises 85% of all disc herniations; 70% occur from T11 to L3. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and occasionally cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Type I\u2014dachshund; shih tzu, Lhaso apso; Pekingese, cocker spaniel, Welsh corgi; toy and miniature poodle. \u2022 Type II\u2014large breeds, but may occur in any breed. \u2022 Type III\u2014active agility, racing, or working breeds; greyhound; border collie; Australian shepherd. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Type I\u20143\u20136 years of age. \u2022 Type II\u20148\u201310 years of age; cats: mean age of 10 years. \u2022 Type III\u2014any age; occurs during exertion or trauma. SIGNS General Comments The severity of clinical signs depends on the type of herniation, velocity of disc contact with the spinal cord, amount and duration of cord compression, location (upper motor neuron [UMN] or lower motor neuron [LMN]), and regional spinal canal/spinal cord diameter ratio (cervical vs. thoracolumbar). Historical Findings \u2022 Onset may be peracute or acute in chondrodystrophoid dogs (type I disease) and may occur during vigorous activity. \u2022 Larger dogs or smaller dogs with type II disease have a more insidious onset and tend to worsen with time. \u2022 Dogs with type III disease have a history of active exertion followed by sudden loss of function, or of severe traumatic origin such as vehicular trauma or racing injury. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Thoracolumbar pain is a common finding in dogs; reluctant to ambulate and hunched posture; careful palpation of spinous processes and epaxial musculature produces distinct localized pain; often some degree of paraparesis with decreased or absent proprioception or decreased motor ability in the pelvic limbs. \u2022 Myotactic spinal reflexes in the pelvic limbs are exaggerated (hyperreflexive) when the lesion is between T3 and L3; reflexes are decreased (hyporeflexive) when lesion is caudal to L3. \u2022 Superficial and deep pain perception may be decreased or absent in the pelvic limbs. \u2022 Presence of deep pain sensation is the single most reliable prognostic factor for return to acceptable function; pain perception should be conscious in nature and not confused with a withdrawal reflex (local spinal reflex); in animals with diminished conscious deep pain response, observation of mydriasis or tachycardia may be useful in confirming the presence of deep pain. \u2022 Forelimb function is normal with thoracolumbar disc rupture; occasionally Schiff\u2013Sherrington phenomena may cause increased muscle tone in the forelimbs, but this clinical sign is location related only and does not indicate a poor prognosis. \u2022 Urinary incontinence or retention is common when the lesion affects motor function. \u2022 Pain is less obvious in cats; the site of herniation is often lumbar. CAUSES \u2022 Chondroid or fibroid degeneration of the thoracolumbar intervertebral discs. \u2022 Acute trauma that overloads the capacity of the intervertebral disc to absorb force and ruptures the dorsal annulus. \u2022 15% of animals with spinal fractures have been reported to have disc extrusions in addition to the fracture/luxation. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Type I disease most often affects chondrodystrophic breeds. \u2022 Racing and breeds used for agility competition are at risk for Type III disk disease.", "Intussusception": " \u2022 Invagination of one gastrointestinal (GI) segment into the lumen of the adjacent segment. \u2022 Intussusceptions are classified according to their localization within the GI tract\u2014ileocolic and jejunojejunal intussusceptions are the most common; other types include gastroesophageal, duodenojejunal, and cecocolic. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The mechanism is unknown\u2014GI irritation and hypermotility may cause the orad segment to invaginate into the aborad segment; uncoupling of coordinated peristaltic rhythm may be a contributing factor. \u2022 Intussusception often leads to a partial or complete mechanical obstruction of the GI tract. \u2022 Compromise of venous and lymphatic drainage of the affected bowel leads to marked edema and intramural hemorrhage, and, if left untreated, loss of segmental arterial supply and necrosis; full\u00adthickness compromise of the integrity of the bowel may occur leading to septic peritonitis. \u2022 The segment entrapped within the lumen is the intussusceptum; the engulfing segment is the intussuscipiens. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 GI\u2014partial or complete mechanical obstruction, bowel wall necrosis, hematochezia, melena, hypermotility followed by ileus, vomiting, and diarrhea. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014distributive and hypovolemic shock (vomiting and diarrhea, intraluminal hemorrhage, peritonitis).

Mean Age and Range \u2022 Most commonly younger animals. \u2022 Older affected animals should be evaluated for underlying disease such as chronic enteropathy and intestinal neoplasia. Predominant Sex None SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Clinical signs depend on the inciting cause, location and type of intussusception, completeness of obstruction, degree of bowel wall compromise and presence of peritonitis. \u2022 Gastroesophageal intussusceptions present with the most acute and severe clinical signs compared to more aborad locations. Historical Findings \u2022 Recent foreign body ingestion. \u2022 Previous or current enteropathy. \u2022 Vomiting. \u2022 Diarrhea. \u2022 Hematochezia. \u2022 Hematemesis. \u2022 Melena. \u2022 Abdominal pain. \u2022 Abdominal distention. \u2022 Decreased appetite or anorexia. \u2022 Weight loss. \u2022 Historical findings are typically acute in onset, but chronic cases are reported.

CAUSES \u2022 Any disease that alters GI motility. \u2022 Acute or chronic enteropathy and enteritis. \u2022 Recent abdominal surgery. \u2022 Intestinal mural disease or intraluminal foreign body. \u2022 Intestinal parasitism. \u2022 Less common causes include renal allograft transplantation (8\u201333% incidence) and hematopoietic cell grafts (5% incidence) in dogs. The reason for this relationship is unclear. RISK FACTORS Presence of any condition listed under Causes.", "Iris Atrophy": " \u2022 Degeneration of iris tissues; both the iris stroma and posterior iris epithelium can be affected, resulting in loss of iris sphincter and dilator muscle function, atrophy of iris vessels, and loss of iris pigment. \u2022 Both the pupillary margin and more peripheral portions of the iris can be affected, resulting in an iris that is thin or has areas of full\u2010thickness tissue loss. \u2022 Senile or secondary change. \u2022 Secondary iris atrophy is usually a result of chronic inflammation (uveitis). \u2022 Iris sphincter muscle is frequently affected by atrophy, resulting in incomplete pupillary constriction, unequal pupil size (anisocoria), and possibly abnormal pupil shape (dyscoria). \u2022 Irregular scalloped, moth\u2010eaten pupil margin is a common manifestation. \u2022 Pupil margin may remain unaffected; peripheral loss of iris tissue can cause large holes in the iris that resemble multiple pupillary openings. \u2022 Vision largely unaffected.

SIGNALMENT \u2022 Predominantly dogs, uncommon in other species. \u2022 All ages susceptible. SIGNS \u2022 History of iron ingestion or injectable overdose. \u2022 Initial signs related to GI irritation and mucosal damage; onset of signs occurs within 6\u20138 hours post ingestion; may include vomiting, diarrhea, mucosal damage (hematemesis, melena), abdominal pain and depression; signs with mild to moderate ingestions may not progress beyond GI. \u2022 In absence of significant initial GI signs, systemic toxicity unlikely. \u2022 A quiet/latent period may follow initial GI signs and last up to 24 hours post ingestion. \u2022 In severe cases, recurrence of clinical signs occurs 12\u201396 hours post ingestion and can include ongoing vomiting/diarrhea \u00b1 mucosal damage, tachycardia, hypotension, CV collapse, metabolic acidosis, shock, hepatic necrosis, coagulopathy/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury, seizures, death. \u2022 Following GI involvement, scarring and stricture formation may occur during healing. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Ingestion of iron-containing medication or other materials. \u2022 Majority of cases due to canine dietary indiscretion. \u2022 Elemental/ absorbable iron results in mild signs at 20 mg/kg PO and severe signs at 60 mg/kg; other forms of iron including iron salts require conversion to elemental iron for dose calculations. \u2022 Metallic iron and iron oxide (rust)not readily ionizable/absorbable and toxicity not expected.", "Ivermectin and Other Macrocyclic Lactones Toxicosis": " \u2022 Ivermectin, milbemycin, moxidectin, selamectin, others. \u2022 Toxicity\u2014dogs given large extra-label dosages ( > 10\u201315 times recommended dosage). \u2022 Ivermectin\u2014binds to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells causing subsequent paralysis and death of the parasite. Also interacts with other ligand-gated chloride channels, including those gated by \ud835\udefe -aminobutyric acid (GABA). \u2022 Sensitivity\u2014collies and certain other breeds are more sensitive to high doses of ivermectin. This sensitivity has been associated with an inherited deletion of the ABCB1-1\u2206 gene that encodes a transmembrane protein pump called P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein is believed to transport ivermectin out of brain tissue and into circulation. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs. \u2022 Collies\u2014most commonly affected. \u2022 Dogs homozygous for the ABCB1-1\u2206 gene deletion also affected; heterozygous dogs can react at higher doses.

Subluxation is a partial disruption. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Synovial joints have a joint capsule that joins the articulating bones together. The fibrous layer of this capsule is a primary stabilizer of the joint. Most joints have additional ligaments that reinforce the joint capsule to improve the resistance to movement outside of the normal range of motion of that joint. All motion joints also have a system of muscles and tendons that exert forces on the joint to control movement and prevent subluxation of the joint. The co-contraction forces around a joint are very influential on the stability of the joint. Instability occurs when the stabilizing system is damaged, disrupted, or does not develop normally. \u2022 If laxity is clinically apparent, then the instability is generally described as luxation or subluxation of the joint. \u2022 Luxation may occur as a result of traumatic forces causing the joint to move beyond the elastic limits of the supporting tissues. \u2022 Secondary changes are set in motion by damage to the tissues that creates early, and then later, more chronic joint damage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014primarily the intraarticular environment and the support structures around the joint, including joint capsule, fibrocartilage, collateral ligaments, and supporting muscle/tendon units. \u2022 Neurologic\u2014neurologic feedback and supply to the support system may also be affected. GENETICS \u2022 Hyperlaxity syndrome is an inherited trait in humans. Puppies may show temporary hyperlaxity when confined or when housed on poor substrates. \u2022 Hip dysplasia is a form of inherited laxity of the coxofemoral joint. \u2022 Shoulder luxation is an inherited predisposition in small breeds, such as miniature poodles. \u2022 Femoropatellar instability leading to medial patellar luxation is a common inherited disease in small-breed dogs. \u2022 Ehlers\u2013 Danlos syndrome is a congenital collagen disorder that leads to generalized joint laxity. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Various forms of laxity/luxation (specifically hip dysplasia and medial patella luxation) are very common. Other forms such as Ehlers\u2013 Danlos syndrome are extremely uncommon. SIGNALMENT Species All species. Breed Predilections \u2022 Traumatic luxation has not been shown to be breed specific in any joint. \u2022 Breed predilection for nontraumatic luxations varies with the joint affected. \u2022 Hip\u2014large breeds show clinical signs of hip dysplasia more frequently than smaller breeds, but breeds of all sizes can have radiographic signs. \u2022 Congenital shoulder luxation occurs most commonly in miniature breeds (miniature poodle). \u2022 Medial patella luxation is more common in small-breed dogs. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Traumatic\u2014any age. \u2022 Congenital laxity/ luxation is typically seen in the juvenile dog, with secondary degenerative joint disease showing later in life.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Most pediatric behavior problems are normal, species-typical behaviors. \u2022 Lack of appropriate social interactions and environmental stimulation and genetics can contribute to abnormal or unwanted behaviors. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Behavioral GENETICS Paternal influences on friendliness to people and boldness to unfamiliar or novel objects have been supported. SIGNALMENT Species Cats Mean Age and Range Generally 6\u201348 weeks. SIGNS General Comments Play Aggression \u2022 Elements of predation including stalking, chasing, attacking, pouncing, swatting, and biting. Play can be solitary, with objects, or social to another kitten, animal or person. \u2022 With normal play, bites are inhibited and claws retracted. Vocalizations are rare compared to other forms of feline aggression. \u2022 Inappropriate play behaviors may be uninhibited, leading to bite and scratch injuries. Excessive Play/Activity and/or Destructive Play High level of solitary play (running, jumping, climbing, object play) may result in household damage and disruption. Scratching \u2022 Use of claws to scratch on household items and/or people. \u2022 Scratching is a normal behavior for claw maintenance, territorial marking, and defense but becomes problematic when scratched objects include walls, furniture, carpets, and other household items. Fearful Behaviors Includes hiding, hissing, scratching, and unsocial behaviors and can include varying manifestations of aggression to another animal or person. Historical Findings Aggressive Play Directed toward People or Other Pets in the Household \u2022 Attacks directed toward people or other pets in the household. \u2022 Ambushes are common and lack vocalizations. Bites are generally inhibited but may puncture the skin and light scratches with claws may occur. Can be more serious in the elderly owner. Uninhibited Aggressive Play Directed toward People \u2022 Signs similar to above except more intense. \u2022 Bites and scratches are not as inhibited and can break skin. Play Directed toward Household Objects \u2022 Bursts of solitary play that include intense running, climbing across and up household furnishings. \u2022 Knocks or swipes objects from surfaces. Scratching Household items and family members. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Due to Lack of Socialization \u2022 Insufficient exposure to people before 7\u20139 weeks of age. \u2022 Behaviors associated with fear, e.g., dilated pupils, piloerection, defensive postures, hissing, hiding, fleeing, aggression. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Related to Early Trauma Normal until experience traumatic event, e.g., abuse, attack by another animal. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Related to Correction Techniques \u2022 History of punishment by owner(s). \u2022 Kitten shows defensive postures including hissing, fleeing, hiding, dilated pupils, piloerection in presence of owner or in response to corrections. CAUSES Aggressive Play Directed toward People or Other Cats in the Household \u2022 Normal species-typical behavior but without appropriate social interaction with conspecifics, the behavior can become uninhibited and injurious. \u2022 Owners may encourage inappropriate interactive play by promoting play with human body parts (fingers, hands, feet). \u2022 Lack of outlets for appropriate play. Play Directed toward Objects in the Household Normal species-typical behavior beginning at 7\u20138 weeks of age. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Due to Lack of Early Socialization No or minimal amount of exposure to people before 7\u20139 weeks of age. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Related to Early Trauma Early traumatic event. Fear and Defensive Behaviors Related to Correction Techniques Normal until \u201ccorrected\u201d by person, e.g., spanked, swatted, flicked on nose, yelled at, chased.

Play Directed toward Objects in the Household \u2022 Lack of sufficient/appropriate enrichment including toys and interactive play with people or other animals. \u2022 Only pet in household. Scratching Lack of appropriate/inadequate scratching outlets. Fear and Defensive Behaviors \u2022 Lack of appropriate socialization with people, use of punishment and other traumatic experience(s). \u2022 Removing kittens less than 2 weeks of age from queen may result in fearful and aggressive kittens towards humans and other cats.", "Kitten Socialization and Kitten Classes": " \u2022 Early experiences set the foundation for future behavior, having long lasting effects on social behavior, temperament, and the ability to learn and relate to various stimuli and to cope in various environmental contexts. \u2022 For a kitten to grow up into a well-adjusted adult cat, adequate socialization and environmental exposure is needed during the socialization period and beyond into the first year of life. Definitions \u2022 Socialization\u2014a process of learning normal behavior, communication, and social skills for appropriate interactions with other individuals in various contexts. \u2022 Socialization period\u2014a sensitive window of development whereby a cat learns to communicate and relate to other cats, humans, and the environment. \u2022 Kitten classes\u2014also called kitten \u201ckindy\u201d or kindergarten. Allow cats to socialize with other cats, a variety of people, and to be exposed to multiple and varied environmental stimuli in a positive and nonthreatening manner. Pathophysiology Potential effects on behavioral and neurological development. SIGNALMENT Genetics Genetics or the paternity of the kittens, with kittens sired from friendly toms being friendlier toward people. Mean Age \u2022 The sensitive socialization period is between 2 weeks and 7 weeks, yet socialization is a continuous process. During the socialization period, less experience is necessary to produce profound effects on future behavior. Handling only 15 minutes per day from 2 to 6 weeks of age has been shown to produce more friendly kittens. \u2022 For kitten classes\u2014healthy dewormed kittens should begin attending group classes 10 days after receiving the first vaccination of their kitten immunization series. Typically begin classes between 8 and 12 weeks and conclude by 14 weeks. Predominant Sex \u2022 Male kittens play more with objects than females. \u2022 No sex differences in social play. SIGNS \u2022 Lack of adequate socialization experiences during sensitive periods of development. \u2022 Cat-directed fear and/or aggression\u2014lack of early familiarity and positive exposure with other cats. \u2022 Human-directed fear and/or aggression\u2014early positive social experiences with humans prior to 7 weeks, otherwise fear, avoidance, aggression, and behaving as if \u201cferal.\u201d \u2022 Predatory aggression\u2014exposure to future prey species, starting at 4 weeks, can improve predatory behavior and hunting ability, whereas exposure to non-prey species may reduce aggression later in life. \u2022 Fear and anxiety in unfamiliar environments. \u2022 Attendance at group kitten classes at an early age can prevent future behavior problems and/or allow for the early identification of abnormal and problematic behavior. \u2022 Kitten classes\u2014age-specific (8 and 12 weeks at start and finished by 14 weeks) for group-controlled interactions. Focus is education regarding normal behavior, the prevention of behavior problems, and addressing normal problematic behaviors through management, supervision, and positive reinforcement training. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Avoiding environmental and social experiences prior to the completion of kitten vaccination series increases the risk of future behavior problems. \u2022 The risk of exposure to infectious disease with socialization and environmental exposure needs to be considered along with the risk of being undersocialized and not suitable as a pet because of lifelong fear, anxiety, and aggressive issues. \u2022 A clean bill of health and initial vaccinations must have been administered at least 10 days prior to class. \u2022 Kittens should be dewormed according to the Companion Animal Parasite Council guidelines. https:// capcvet.org/guidelines/general-guidelines/ \u2022 Kittens should be screened for contagious diseases, such as upper respiratory infection and ringworm, prior to each class. \u2022 Kitten classes \u201cvaccinate\u201d the kitten against behavior problems later in life. \u2022 Genetics and a lack of socialization can render some kittens intolerant to human handling and behaving as if feral. \u2022 Kittens removed from the queen and exclusively hand raised by humans are more fearful and aggressive toward cats and humans, tend to be hyperactive, have difficulty forming social attachments with other cats, and display poor learning ability. \u2022 Removal from the queen and littermates prior to 10 weeks of age may increase the risk of inter-cat aggression with a lack of learned social skills. \u2022 Kittens weaned too early are more likely to perform non-nutritive suckling and kneading of objects. \u2022 Experiences at the veterinary clinic should employ Fear Free and/or Low Stress handling techniques. \u2022 Traumatic experiences that induce fear during sensitive fear periods when the kitten is between 6 and 8 weeks of age should be avoided. \u2022 Avoiding exposure to other species during socialization may result in fear toward the species, whereas experience with species that might normally have a predator\u2013prey relationship may increase predatory behavior toward that species. \u2022 Early exposure of kittens to dogs living within the household improves the likelihood of successful cohabitation. \u2022 Kitten socialization with people and cats is only beneficial to behavioral development if the kitten finds human and/or cat contact enjoyable. Continued exposure when it induces fear is unlikely to result in habituation to the stimulus and is likely to exacerbate fear and/ or aggression.", "Lactic Acidosis (Hyperlactatemia)": " \u2022 Blood lactate concentration >1.5 mmol/L in dogs and >1.8 mmol/L in cats. \u2022 Lactic acidosis is hyperlactatemia with concurrent metabolic acidosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Plasma lactate is a late but quantitative indicator of tissue hypoperfusion. Hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia occur before a rise in blood lactate is detectable. \u2022 Lactic acid is the end product of anaerobic glucose metabolism; at physiologic pH, lactic acid immediately dissociates to lactate and hydrogen ions. Clinically significant lactate accumulation can be due to anaerobic glycolysis occurring during normal physiologic (e.g., exercise) or pathologic processes (e.g., shock, seizures). \u2022 Lactate exists as levorotatory (l\u00adlactate) and dextrorotatory (d\u00adlactate) stereoisomers. l\u00adLactate predominates in mammalian cells and is the only form detectable by routine analysis. \u2022 Hepatic and renal lactate metabolism maintains a balance between lactate production and clearance. \u2022 In most critically ill or injured patients, hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis are due to conditions that cause tissue hypoxia, with a shift to anaerobic glycolysis. \u2022 Inadequate perfusion, severe hypoxemia, increased oxygen demand, decreased hemoglobin concentration, or combinations of these factors can cause tissue hypoxia. \u2022 Clinically evident tissue hypoperfusion does not usually occur in patients with hyperlactatemia alone, but hyperlactatemia from \u201coccult\u201d hypoperfusion (not detectable by routine monitoring) might be a precursor to overt hypoperfusion. \u2022 Lactic acidosis can occur secondary to marked tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion, certain drugs or toxins, or congenital defects in carbohydrate metabolism. \u2022 Blood lactate measurement is a useful tool for assessing severity of tissue hypoxia, response to therapy, and prognosis: \u25e6 In human trauma and shock patients, lactate predicts outcome, and mortality is correlated with severity of lactic acidosis. \u25e6 Lactate concentrations are increased in critically ill and injured dogs; severity of hyperlactatemia is associated with outcome. \u2022 Serial lactate measurement allows the clinician to assess the response of critically ill patients to resuscitative therapy (decreasing lactate concentration indicates restoration of tissue oxygen delivery). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014persistent lactic acidosis associated with impaired cardiac contractility, impaired pressor response to catecholamines, increased sensitivity of myocardium to ventricular arrhythmias, and reduced cardiac output. These changes may worsen organ hypoperfusion, leading to further tissue hypoxia. \u2022 As acidosis and tissue hypoxia become severe, failure of multiple organ systems and death can occur. SIGNALMENT Dog and cat. SIGNS General Comments Signs relate more to underlying disorder than to direct effects of acidosis. As tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and acidosis worsen, signs of dysfunction can occur in any organ system. Historical Findings Disorders causing lactic acidosis are common; historical facts should prompt suspicion of an underlying acidosis. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Tachypnea is usually present due to attempted respiratory compensation. \u2022 Most patients with acidosis are hypovolemic and demonstrate poor tissue perfusion or dehydration\u2014dark mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, or increased skin turgor. \u2022 Severely acidotic patients might have cardiac dysrhythmias and weak pulses. CAUSES \u2022 Two types of hyperlactatemia, A and B, based on presence or absence of hypoperfusion or tissue hypoxia. \u2022 Type A hyperlactatemia\u2014more common; due to decreased or inadequate oxygen delivery or increased oxygen demand. Causes of type A hyperlactatemia include shock, regional hypoperfusion, arterial obstruction, severe hypoxemia or anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and severe motor seizures. \u2022 Increased oxygen demand can be caused by increased muscle activity (e.g., exercise, tremors, struggling, fever, seizure activity). \u2022 Type B hyperlactatemia\u2014all other causes of lactic acidosis; subdivided into three subsets (B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ); characterized by absence of hypoxemia or poor tissue perfusion. Many causes of type B lactic acidosis might be \u201coccult\u201d hypoperfusion not detectable by routine monitoring parameters or possibly combinations of types A and B lactic acidosis. \u25e6 Type B 1 hyperlactatemia is associated with diseases such as sepsis, neoplasia, liver disease and diabetes mellitus. \u25e6 Type B 2 hyperlactatemia is associated with a wide variety of drugs or toxins including corticosteroids, activated charcoal, propofol, lactulose, morphine, terbutaline, theophylline, xylitol, and parenteral nutrition. \u25e6 Type B 3 hyperlactatemias are caused by congenital metabolic diseases, mitochondrial myopathies, and enzyme deficiencies. \u2022 Most common causes of type B lactic acidosis in veterinary medicine include neoplasia, alkalosis, sepsis, renal failure, liver disease, catecholamine use (norepinephrine, epinephrine), and intoxications (strychnine, cyanide, ethylene glycol, salicylates, acetaminophen, propylene glycol). \u2022 Elevated blood lactate has been observed in patients with lymphoma and meningioma. Though the type and cause of hyperlactatemia in these animals is not clearly understood, the presence of a high lactate should prompt the clinician to evaluate other markers of perfusion (heart rate, mucous membrane color, pulse quality, capillary refill, serum creatinine) before attempting aggressive fluid resuscitation. \u2022 Metformin intoxication is associated with severe lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia in people and dogs.

Caused by penetrating, intraluminal, or blunt cervical or thoracic trauma. Severity ranges from small perforation to complete avulsion. With complete avulsion, mediastinal tissues can form a pseudomembrane to maintain airway patency. Laryngeal perforation is disruption of laryngeal structures (thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid cartilages) and can create similar leakage of air and may result in upper airway obstruction. Systems Affected \u2022 Respiratory\u2014compromise of airway, possible pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. Laryngeal swelling may result in upper airway obstruction. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax can decrease venous return and cardiac output. \u2022 Nervous, musculoskeletal\u2014depends on severity of hypoxia. \u2022 Skin\u2014SC emphysema, initially cervical but can affect entire body.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Access to outside while unsupervised causing increased risk of all types of trauma. \u2022 Exposure to other animals causing increased risk of bite wounds. \u2022 Penetrating cervical wounds\u2014bite wounds, impalement, projectile missiles, foreign bodies. \u2022 Iatrogenic perforation during endotracheal intubation, transtracheal wash, jugular venipuncture, cervical surgery, radiation therapy, tracheal stent fracture, or failure to deflate cuff or to stabilize the tube while repositioning patient. Overinflation of endotracheal cuff can cause a linear tear in the trachealis muscle at thoracic inlet or intrathoracic trachea. Occurs most often with dental procedures. \u2022 Blunt trauma can cause intrathoracic tracheal avulsion. \u2022 Blunt trauma to the cervical region can cause laryngeal avulsion or fracture.", "Laryngeal Diseases": " \u2022 The larynx is made of cartilage structures surrounding the rima glottis. The functions of the larynx are to control airflow during respiration, protect the lower airways from aspiration during swallowing, and control phonation. \u2022 Laryngeal diseases in dogs and cats include laryngeal paralysis, laryngitis, laryngeal collapse, foreign body obstruction, neoplasia, and trauma. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Decreased diameter of the laryngeal opening increases resistance to airflow during inspiration and results in stridor on inspiration. The decrease in airflow will lead to hypoxemia, cyanosis, and/or respiratory distress and a decrease in heat exchange (heat intolerance, hyperthermia). \u2022 Inflammation or lesions of the vocal cords can lead to aphonia or change in bark/meow. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014respiratory distress, often associated with airway obstruction. Aspiration pneumonia may develop. Stridor is common. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hypoxemia/distress may lead to tachycardia; laryngeal stimulation may trigger vagal response (bradycardia). \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014retching, regurgitation, vomiting, and/or dysphagia can occur when polyneuropathy causes laryngeal paralysis and esophageal dysfunction; esophagitis is frequently associated with brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS). \u2022 Nervous\u2014depression, stupor, or coma may occur if severe laryngeal obstruction leads to severe hyperthermia. Older dogs with laryngeal paralysis often have geriatric-onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy (GOLPP), which includes hind limb weakness. GENETICS \u2022 Juvenile laryngeal paralysis in the bouvier des Flandres is transmitted as a dominant trait. \u2022 In laryngeal paralysis associated with polyneuropathy in the Leonberger dog, X-linked inheritance is suggested. \u2022 No other laryngeal disorder has been proven to be genetic in the dog or cat, but familial conditions and breed predispositions have been reported. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 More common in dogs than in cats. \u2022 Currently, congenital laryngeal paralysis is only sporadic in the bouvier des Flandres. \u2022 Idiopathic laryngeal paralysis is a common disease of older large-breed dogs; exact prevalence unknown. \u2022 BAS is a common syndrome in French and English bulldogs. \u2022 Laryngeal trauma may occur in conjunction with bite wounds; tracheal bite wounds may result in laryngeal paralysis/collapse due to damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. \u2022 Neoplasia is rare in dogs, but fairly common in older cats, who are often initially thought to have lower airway disease due to \u201cwheezing\u201d that accompanies laryngeal masses. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Familial laryngeal paralysis/polyneuropathy complex occurs in the Dalmatian, Rottweiler, Leonberger, and Pyrenean mountain dog (great Pyrenees). \u2022 Congenital laryngeal paralysis is found in bouviers des Flandres, huskies, husky crosses, white German shepherd dogs, and probably bull terriers. \u2022 Idiopathic acquired laryngeal paralysis is most often found in large-breed dogs (especially Labrador and golden retrievers). \u2022 BAS is found in brachycephalic breeds of dogs. \u2022 Upper airway obstruction due to laryngeal collapse or narrowed laryngeal opening occurs in Norwich terriers. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Congenital and familial laryngeal paralysis\u2014 onset of signs usually in the first months of life (2 and 8 months). Later in the Leonberger, 1\u20139 years, and white German shepherd dog, 2 years. \u2022 Acquired laryngeal paralysis\u2014possible at any age but more frequent in older dogs. \u2022 Neoplasia\u2014middle-aged to old dogs.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Travel to or acquisition from endemic regions. \u2022 Coinfections (e.g., E. canis , retroviruses), immunosuppression, or malnutrition predispose.", "Leishmaniosis, Cutaneous": " Leishmaniosis is a group of infectious diseases occurring throughout the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, parts of Asia, and Central and South America. It is caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania , and Leishmania infantum is the most common cause of disease in the dog. It occurs infrequently in the cat. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Infection is transmitted by the bite of female sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus in Europe and Lutzomia in the New World. Nonvectorial transmission modalities have been demonstrated (venereal, vertical, dog-to-dog, blood transfusion), but are much less common. Following inoculation of a small number of promastigotes into the dermis, the innate immune response (complement, neutrophils, macrophages) and then the adaptive response (T-cellmediated) attempt to control the infection. A high percentage of dogs develop an effective T helper-1 response, resulting in subclinical infection and becoming seronegative or developing a low anti- Leishmania antibody titer. A smaller group of dogs develop a predominantly T helper-2 response, have elevated antibody titers (immunoglobulin G [IgGs]), and allow the progression of the infection causing lesions and clinical signs. Active infection causes lesions by different mechanisms, including an acute inflammatory response (fever, lethargy, asthenia) and granulomatous inflammatory lesions, by generating immunocomplexes that are deposited in different organs causing inflammation and tissue damage (glomerulonephritis, arthritis, uveitis). SYSTEMS AFFECTED Infection with Leishmania infantum (CanL) is considered systemic. Rarely (papulonodular cutaneous form), the infection is exclusively cutaneous. From the dermis, infection first spreads to the hematopoietic organs (bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen) and then systemically. The spread of infection and the involvement of numerous organs and systems explains the clinical pleomorphism of the disease. GENETICS Several haplotypes, possibly associated with tendency to develop a T helper-2 response, are associated with increased susceptibility to the development of the disease. Some breeds, including German shepherd dog, boxer, Rottweiler, Alaskan Malamutes, appear to be susceptible. Conversely, some autochthonous Mediterranean breeds (e.g., Ibizian hound) respond with an effective cellular response and very rarely develop clinical signs. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE In areas where CanL is endemic, the prevalence of infection is very high (over 50%) with seroprevalences ranging between 5% and 30%. However, less than 5% of dogs develop clinical signs. Isolated cases have been observed in non-endemic areas (Northern Europe, United States), most often in dogs that have visited areas where the disease is endemic. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION  GRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Found in Mediterranean countries, Portugal, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, and Central and South America.

Evaluation of individual leukocyte absolute numbers is needed to discern the cellular population(s) causing the overall increase in WBC count. Neutrophilia is the most common cause of a total WBC increase, and a left shift with toxic changes (e.g., D\u00f6hle bodies, cytoplasmic basophilia, foamy cytoplasmic vacuolation, and/or toxic granulation) may be present. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY One or more of the following mechanisms: \u2022 Inflammation and increased tissue demand for leukocytes causing myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow. \u2022 Translocation of cells from the marginating pool to the circulating pool of large vessels. \u2022 Altered cytokine production resulting in increased release of cells from marrow storage pool. \u2022 Decreased migration to tissues. \u2022 Delayed apoptosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Chronic inflammation/leukocytosis may lead to nonspecific tissue damage and organ dysfunction. GENETICS Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an uncommon, autosomal recessive, primary immunodeficiency resulting in reduced neutrophil adhesion and inability to migrate to tissues.

One report of infection in a cat from Ohio and one from Illinois. It is the most common trematode infection affecting the liver of companion pets in North America. \u2022 Infestation acquired from ingestion of infected intermediate host (e.g., lizard or frog). \u2022 Estimated 15\u201385% of cats with intermediate host access are infected in endemic areas. \u2022 Heterobilharzia americana\u2014 raccoon is the natural definitive host and most important reservoir host; dogs can also serve as the definitive host.

SIGNS \u2022 Cats ( P. concinnum )\u2014depends on severity of infection. \u2022 Most infected cats lack clinical signs. \u2022 With severe infestation\u2014jaundice, emaciation, anorexia, vomiting, mucoid diarrhea, hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, malaise, fever. \u2022 Dogs ( H. americana )\u2014lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, inappetence, hypercalcemia, polyuria/polydipsia (PU/PD), melena. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS P. concinnum \u2022 Adults reside in bile ducts and gallbladder; life cycle requires two intermediate hosts and tropical or semitropical climate. \u2022 Embryonated eggs pass in cat\u2019s feces; ingested by first intermediate host (a land snail). \u2022 Miracidia hatch from eggs in the snail penetrating host tissue and develop sporocysts. \u2022 Mature daughter sporocysts emerge from the snail and thereafter are ingested by a second intermediate host, usually an anole lizard (but also skinks, geckos, frogs, and toads); enter bile ducts where they reside until host ingested as prey by the cat. \u2022 Cercariae released in the upper digestive tract of the cat; migrate to the bile ducts where they mature and shed eggs within 8 weeks. \u2022 Risk factors for infection\u2014tropical or subtropical climate; appropriate intermediate hosts; access to an outdoor or indoor/outdoor environment; successful hunting skills; consumption of infected intermediate host. Metorchis conjunctus \u2022 In cats\u2014may infect the liver and biliary structures initially causing watery bloodtinged diarrhea and later evidence of biliary tree invasion; eggs are passed in feces 17 days from initial infection. \u2022 Infection typically associated with increased liver enzyme and may be associated with transient eosinophilia. Heterobilharzia americana \u2022 Eggs containing fully developed miracidium are passed in feces of definitive (final) host. In fresh water, eggs hatch, release miracidia that penetrate snail hosts, where sporocysts develop. Cercaria released from snail host 25 days after infection; these infect vertebrate host (dog, human) by skin penetration. \u2022 Adult flukes develop in liver and migrate to mesenteric veins where eggs disseminate to various viscera, including liver, pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and intestines; there they initiate granulomatous inflammation and sclerotic vascular lesions. \u2022 Healing leads to scar formation and organ injury that can result in liver failure and gastrointestinal malabsorption. \u2022 Eggs appear in feces 68 days after infection.

SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Organisms persist associated with collagen and fibroblasts in skin, joints, tendons, pericardium, peritoneum, meninges, muscle, heart, and lymph nodes; rarely found in body fluids. \u2022 Pathologic changes\u2014with few exceptions restricted to joints, draining lymph nodes; rarely, immune-complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN). GENETICS Genetic predisposition for infection (not illness) in beagles and Bernese mountain dogs. Labrador and golden retrievers are predisposed to LN, but it remains rare (proteinuria is not associated with seropositivity). INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Seroprevalence in dogs varies with exposure to infected ticks in endemic areas (5\u201330%). In some areas before tick control was common, seroprevalence was 70\u201390% in healthy dogs. \u2022 Clinical Lyme borreliosis (LB) develops in small fraction of infected individuals; coinfections with other organisms (e.g., Anaplasma phagocytophilum ) may impact outcome. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Northern hemisphere: \u25e6 North America\u2014most cases reported in the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, Upper Midwest, adjacent Canada. Ecologic conditions supporting LB exist in adjacent states and on West Coast. \u25e6 Europe\u2014central; less frequent in areas bordering Mediterranean basin. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and rarely cat. Mean Age and Range Experimentally, puppies are more susceptible than adult dogs. SIGNS \u2022 LA\u2014acute or recurrent lameness in one or more legs; possible fever, anorexia, depression, local lymphadenopathy. Affected joints may be swollen, warm, painful. Self-limiting or responds well to antibiotic treatment. \u2022 Experimentally\u2014puppies developed acute self-limiting (3\u20134 days) form of LA in the leg closest to tick bite; may reoccur weeks later in the same or other leg. Older puppies had fewer signs; adult untreated dogs showed no clinical signs but had histologic changes of chronic nonerosive polyarthritis; 10\u201315% were persistent carriers despite antimicrobial therapy \u2022 LN\u2014protein-losing nephropathy (PLN) due to ICGN; may present for renal failure, thromboembolism, hypertension, or nephrotic syndrome. CAUSES \u2022 Bb \u2014transmitted by three-host Ixodes ticks. \u2022 Infection\u2014usually after nymph or adult female tick attachment for 2\u20134 days. Ixodes Ticks \u2022 2- to 3-year life cycle depending on availability of hosts. \u2022 Summer\u2014uninfected eggs laid, hatch in several weeks; become infected by feeding on infected host (small mammal or bird). \u2022 Following spring\u2014larvae molt into nymphs; stay or become infected by feeding on infected host. \u2022 Fall\u2014nymphs molt into adults which stay infected; females mate, feed on larger mammals (e.g., deer); drop off and hide under leaves until laying eggs following summer; males rarely attach or feed. RISK FACTORS Canine LB is a peridomestic disease due to expansion of housing into tick habitat; outdoor activities in endemic areas put dogs at risk.", "Lymphangiectasia": " An obstructive disorder of the lymphatic system of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, resulting in lymphatic hypertension and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Lymphatic obstruction results in dilation and rupture of intestinal lacteals with subsequent loss of lymphatic contents (plasma proteins, lymphocytes, and chylomicrons) into the intestinal lumen. \u2022 Although some of the proteins may be digested and reabsorbed, excessive enteric loss of plasma proteins will ultimately result in panhypoproteinemia. \u2022 Hypoproteinemia causes a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure, which, if severe, will lead to ascites, pleural effusion, and/or (rarely) edema. \u2022 Loss of antithrombin and other anticoagulants can cause a hypercoaguable state. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 GI\u2014diarrhea. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014pleural effusion. \u2022 Skin\u2014subcutaneous edema. \u2022 Systemic\u2014ascites. \u2022 Vascular\u2014thromboembolic disease.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Lymphoid hyperplasia/reactivity\u2014can occur secondary to a localized process like dental disease or localized skin allergies (i.e., pododermatitis). Lymphoid hyperplasia can also be seen secondary to systemic inflammation. Lymph node enlargement can be singular or generalized. \u2022 Lymphadenitis\u2014inflammation within a lymph node can represent a primary process (inflammation or necrosis of the lymph node itself) or a secondary process (drainage of an area of inflammation or necrosis). \u2022 Infectious lymphadenitis\u2014the drainage function of lymph nodes increases their exposure to infectious agents within the node. \u2022 Noninfectious lymphadenitis\u2014often occurs secondary to drainage of areas of inflammation. \u2022 Neoplasia\u2014primary lymph node neoplasia (lymphoma) or metastatic disease.

Mean Age and Range None Predominant Sex None SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Marked submandibular lymph node enlargement can result in difficulty swallowing. \u2022 Clinical signs are often related to systemic disease. Historical Findings \u2022 Owners may report finding mass lesions, particularly when lymph node enlargement is marked. \u2022 Systemic signs of inflammatory disease or organ dysfunction may be reported. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Hyperplastic lymph nodes vary in size. In early stages, lymph nodes may be firm yet still mobile. \u2022 Inflamed lymph nodes are typically large and firm and may be painful. \u2022 Bacterial infection can result in abscess formation within the node, which may rupture and result in draining tracts. Patients may also have fever and other systemic signs of inflammation. \u2022 Lymph nodes affected by lymphoma are often at least twice normal size and very firm. \u2022 Lymph nodes with metastatic neoplasia can have a variable presentation. CAUSES Lymphoid Hyperplasia/Reactivity \u2022 Hyperplastic lymph nodes represent a proliferation of lymphocytes in response to any source of antigenic stimulation. \u2022 Stimulation can be localized where a lymph node drains an area of inflammation. \u2022 Systemic disease can also result in hyperplastic/reactive lymph nodes. \u2022 Chronic hyperplasia can occasionally lead to lymphadenitis. \u2022 A benign condition has been reported in young cats, featuring generalized lymphadenopathy characterized by increased numbers of intermediate to large lymphocytes, which can mimic lymphoma. Care must be taken not to misdiagnose these patients with lymphoma. \u2022 Generalized lymphadenopathy can occur in cats infected with Bartonella spp. or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Neutrophilic Lymphadenitis \u2022 Commonly seen in lymph nodes draining a site of infection. \u2022 Bacterial infection will also result in neutrophilic lymphadenitis, including Streptococcus spp., Brucella spp., Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague). The latter two organisms are more likely to cause lymphadenitis in feline patients. Eosinophilic Lymphadenitis \u2022 Common with dermatitis and parasitic skin diseases. \u2022 Can also be observed with drainage of mast cell tumors, some lymphomas, and with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Granulomatous/Pyogranulomatous Lymphadenitis \u2022 Indicative of chronic inflammation; can occur concurrently with neutrophilic lymphadenitis. \u2022 Multinucleated giant cells with neutrophils indicate pyogranulomatous inflammation. \u2022 Fungal, protozoal, and bacterial infections. Neoplasia \u2022 Lymphoma often results in generalized lymphadenopathy with marked lymph node enlargement. \u2022 Metastatic neoplasia may cause a singular or generalized lymphadenopathy of variable size. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Patients with compromised immune function due to chronic illness or immunosuppressive therapy can be more susceptible to infection and lymphadenitis. \u2022 Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and FIV infection may also be associated with lymphoid neoplasia.", "Lymphedema": " \u2022 Pathologic accumulation of protein-rich lymph into interstitial spaces, especially subcutaneous fat due to primary/secondary failure of lymphatic drainage. \u2022 If chronic, causes tissue fibrosis. \u2022 May be congenital or acquired.

Terms of Malocclusion (American Veterinary Dental College Nomenclature) \u2022 Neutroclusion (Class 1)\u2014a normal rostral\u2013caudal relationship of the maxillary and mandibular dental arches with malposition of one or more individual teeth (dental malocclusion); rostral (anterior) crossbite; mesioversion (\u201clance tooth\u201d), linguoversion (\u201cbase\u00adnarrow\u201d mandibular canine), and caudal (posterior) crossbite. \u2022 Mandibular distoclusion (Class 2)\u2014an abnormal rostral\u2013caudal relationship in which the mandibular arch occludes caudal to its normal position relative to the maxillary arch (skeletal malocclusion). \u2022 Mandibular mesioclusion (Class 3)\u2014an abnormal rostral\u2013caudal relationship in which the mandibular arch occludes rostral to its normal position relative to the maxillary (skeletal malocclusion). \u2022 Asymmetrical skeletal malocclusion\u2014 maxillary\u2013mandibular asymmetry that can occur in a rostro\u00adcaudal direction (unilateral abnormal relationship), in a side\u00adto\u00adside direction (loss of midline alignment), or in a dorso\u00adventral direction with abnormal vertical space between opposing dental arches (open bite). SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats. Breed Predilections Breed predilection for certain malocclusions, some within breed standards. Mean Age and Range Malocclusion usually apparent after eruption of teeth (permanent or deciduous). SIGNS \u2022 Vary greatly according to type, extent, and consequent injuries caused by the malocclusion. \u2022 May be associated with open or closed bites or overcrowding of the teeth. \u2022 Periodontal disease\u2014from crowding or misalignment of teeth. \u2022 Soft tissue defects\u2014from traumatic tooth contact; may be seen in the floor of the mouth and palate; palatal trauma may eventually result in oronasal fistula formation. \u2022 Fractures or attrition (wear) of teeth\u2014may result from improper tooth contact. Class 1 Malocclusions \u2022 Rostral crossbite\u2014palatally displaced maxillary incisor(s) or labially displaced mandibular incisor(s); level bite\u2014maxillary and mandibular cusps contact directly. \u2022 Linguoversion base\u00adnarrow canines\u2014tips of mandibular canines touch palate lingual to normal contact point, just labial to the diastema between corner incisor and maxillary canine (linguoversion). \u2022 Lance teeth\u2014mesioversion of maxillary canine(s); the diastema between the corner incisor and this canine is often diminished and may force the mandibular canine into an abnormal position. Dolichocephalic breeds (e.g., shelties and collies). \u2022 Caudal crossbite\u2014one or more mandibular cheek teeth buccal to maxillary teeth; more common in dolichocephalic breeds (e.g., collies, shelties, some sight hounds).

Risk Factors Hereditary predispositions.", "Mammary Gland Hyperplasia\u2014Cats": " Benign enlargement of one or more m ammary glands. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Young, intact, cycling, or pregnant queens. \u2022 Cats of either gender after gonadectomy (rare in tom). \u2022 Cats of either gender that are receiving exogenous progestogen (e.g., megestrol acetate). \u2022 Less often in older (9\u201312 years) pregnant queens. SIGNS \u2022 Localized or diffuse rapid (2\u20135 weeks) enlargement of one or more mammary glands. \u2022 Firm and nonpainful masses in uncomplicated cases. \u2022 No concurrent signs of systemic illness. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Exaggerated proliferation secondary to an endogenous progesterone influence (pregnancy, pseudopregnancy) or exogenous progestogens (megestrol or medroxyprogesterone acetate). \u2022 May develop after gonadectomy; pa thogenesis may involve progesterone, growth hormone, prolactin, insulin-like growth factors. Suspect ovarian remnant syndrome. \u2022 Reported in one male with adrenocortical carcinoma producing steroid hormones.", "Mammary Gland Tumors\u2014Cats": " Malignant and benign tumors of the mammary glands in cats. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The majority of mammary gland tumors are malignant (85\u201395%) and tend to have an aggressive biologic behavior. Most malignant mammary tumors are adenocarcinomas; sarcomas are rare. \u2022 Exposure to ovarian hormones and exogenous progestin increases risk of mammary tumor development. Intact cats have a 7-fold increased risk of developing mammary tumors as compared to spayed cats. Spaying cats prior to 1 year of age greatly reduces risk of mammary tumor development. \u2022 While less common at diagnosis, pulmonary metastasis occurs in up to 80% of cats. Regional lymph node metastasis is common at diagnosis and may occur in up to 45% of cats. At necropsy, metastasis is identified in >90% of cats; other sites of metastasis may include liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, pleura, peritoneum, and bone. \u2022 Inflammatory mammary carcinomas are rare. These are anaplastic carcinomas with considerable inflammatory cell infiltrates, and are associated with extensive local ulceration, edema, and pain, as well as rapid metastasis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Reproductive\u2014mammary glands. \u2022 Metastasis can affect any organ system, especially the respiratory and lymphatic systems. GENETICS The high incidence of mammary tumors in Siamese cats suggests a genetic component to this disease, but specific genes have not been identified to date. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Third most common neoplasia in cats (after lymphoma and skin tumors). \u2022 The estimated incidence rate is 12.8\u201325.4 per 100,000 cats. SIGNALMENT Species Cat Breed Predilections \u2022 Domestic shorthair and longhair breeds are affected most commonly, but likely reflects the popularity of these breeds rather than a true predilection. \u2022 Siamese cats have twice the risk of other breeds for developing mammary tumors. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Mean\u201410\u201312 years. \u2022 Range\u20149 months to 23 years; most are >5 years of age. \u2022 Siamese cats tend to be diagnosed with mammary tumors at a younger age (mean of 9 years). \u2022 Male cats tend to be diagnosed with mammary tumors at an older age (mean of 12.8 years). Predominant Sex \u2022 Females predominate with only 1\u20135% of mammary carcinomas occurring in male cats. \u2022 While being intact increases the risk of mammary tumors (see Risk Factors), most cats diagnosed with mammary tumors are spayed. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Most cats present for evaluation of a palpable ventral abdominal mass. \u2022 Cats with advanced metastatic disease may present for general signs of illness (e.g., lethargy or anorexia) or for signs attributable to a specific site of metastasis (e.g., dyspnea due to pulmonary metastasis or pleural effusion). \u2022 The duration of clinical signs can vary from days to several months. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Mammary masses can be discrete or infiltrative, soft or firm. Smaller masses often are freely moveable, whereas larger masses can adhere to the underlying abdominal musculature. \u2022 The overlying skin is often intact for smaller tumors, but larger tumors may be ulcerated and inflamed. \u2022 The associated nipple may be inflamed and exude serous fluid. \u2022 Any gland can be affected, although the caudal two glands are affected more commonly. Left and right sides are affected with equal frequency. \u2022 Up to 60% of cats will have multiple tumors on the same and/or opposite mammary chain. \u2022 Axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy (reactive or metastatic) may be present. \u2022 Cats with inflammatory carcinomas present with severe ulceration, erythema, pain, and edema in the ventral abdomen and pelvic limbs. CAUSES Unknown RISK FACTORS \u2022 Compared to intact cats, those spayed at <6 months of age or 6\u201312 months had a 91% and 86% risk reduction, respectively, for mammary carcinoma development, suggesting that hormonal influence is significant. \u2022 There is no obvious protective effect when cats are spayed at > 12 months of age. \u2022 Exogenous progestins (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate) increase the risk of benign and malignant mammary tumor development in female and male cats. In one study, 8 of 22 male cats with mammary carcinomas had a history of exogenous progestin therapy. \u2022 Parity has not been shown to affect mammary tumor development.", "Mammary Gland Tumors\u2014Dogs": " Benign or malignant tumors of the mammary glands in dogs. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Estrogen can exert direct genotoxic effects on mammary epithelium leading to m utations and aneuploidy. \u2022 Progesterone may increase growth hormone and growth hormone receptor expression by the mammary gland, leading to increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) which is associated with p roliferation and survival. \u2022 Most dogs develop multiple tumors due to entire mammary tissue exposed to sex hormones during puberty, i.e., \u201cfield carcinogenesis.\u201d \u2022 Mammary gland tumors are a continuum from benign to malignant. \u2022 Obesity decreases sex hormone-binding globulin, leading to increased concentration of free estrogen.

Underweight at 9\u201312 months of age associated with protective effect.", "Marijuana Toxicosis": " \u2022 Marijuana is a general term that typically refers to Cannabis sativa or C. indica plants and is synonymous with cannabis. Its legal status in North America has changed substantially in the past decade and varies based on the country and state. \u2022 Of the 100+ cannabinoids in marijuana, the primary psychoactive compound (i.e., induces a \u201chigh\u201d) is \u03b4 -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is likely responsible for the clinical signs of poisoning in pets. \u2022 THC extracts can be added to foods or sold in a wide variety of products such as tinctures, capsules, oils, sublingual sprays, topical creams, bath bombs, even suppositories, or made into \u201cconcentrates\u201d\u2014wax-like formulations which are smoked or vaped. \u2022 The minimum lethal dose of marijuana plant material is greater than 3 g/ kg for dogs. \u2022 THC binds to endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. \u2022 Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid commonly used in medical cannabis or sold as a \u201csupplement\u201d for pets and people, is not psychoactive although, depending on the quality of the product, some may inadvertently contain THC. \u2022 Commonly affected organ systems are cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, nervous, ophthalmic, respiratory, renal/urologic. SIGNALMENT Younger animals may be overrepresented due to an increased tendency to ingest foreign items. SIGNS \u2022 Often begin 0.5\u20132 hours after ingestion; may begin in minutes following inhalation. \u2022 Lethargy, ataxia, vomiting, glazed eyes, mydriasis, depression, hypothermia, trembling, urinary incontinence. \u2022 Higher doses may cause bradycardia, hypotension, and coma. Nystagmus, vocalization, sinus tachycardia, seizures, and hyperthermia may also occur. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Intoxication occurs via ingestion of foods containing THC, medical cannabis products, marijuana \u201cconcentrates,\u201d or inhalation of marijuana smoke. Pets in homes of recreational or medical marijuana users are at greater risk for exposure. \u2022 Of the cases reported to Pet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center, about 65% involve food products, the majority of which also contain chocolate. Such foods may contain other toxic ingredients such as raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol, etc. \u2022 Regions with marijuana dispensaries correlate to increased exposures.", "Marking, Roaming, and Mounting Behavior\u2014Cats": " \u2022 Urine marking\u2014depositing of urine on vertical (spraying) or horizontal (especially novel) surfaces for communication (territorial, sexual, or agonistic situations). \u2022 Roaming\u2014escape or wandering for the purpose of seeking mates, defining territory, obtaining food, or sensory stimulation/ enrichment. \u2022 Urine marking and roaming behavior are normal but undesirable behaviors in companion cats. \u2022 Mounting\u2014mating behavior; mounting of inanimate objects for the purpose of masturbation. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Common in intact males, especially if estrus females are present. \u2022 Can also occur in intact females or neutered individuals; marking reported in 10% of neutered males and 5% of spayed females. \u2022 Roaming and mounting may be seen in 5\u201310% of neutered males. \u2022 No age or breed predilection for marking or roaming. \u2022 Mounting may be more common in sexually deprived, intact male cats mounting other males, females, kittens, people, and inanimate objects. SIGNS \u2022 Urine marking\u2014characterized by the cat backing up to vertical object with an erect and quivering tail and projecting a stream of urine backward; may also occur with the cat assuming a squatting posture and depositing urine on horizontal surfaces, notably personal or novel items in the environment; urine deposited on multiple surface types in conjunction with normal litter box use for toileting of urine and feces. \u2022 Mounting\u2014of other cats, people, or objects. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Urine marking may function to delineate territory, aggressive intent, or reproductive communication between cats or as a response to anxiety. \u2022 Likelihood of urine marking increases with density of cats in the household; however, urine marking may occur in households with only 1 or 2 cats. \u2022 Marking associated with social conflict between cats in the same household, introduction of new cats, new furniture, or novel objects. \u2022 Roaming is a normal exploratory behavior for enrichment, food, or sexual activity. \u2022 Roaming is more likely in outdoor cats being housed indoors, intact male cats, and cats with a barren indoor environment (resulting in increased motivation to explore outdoors). \u2022 Mounting can be seen in deprived males or isolated males or if males are housed in pairs.", "Marking, Roaming, and Mounting Behavior\u2014Dogs": " \u2022 Marking, roaming, and mounting fall within the normal behavioral repertoire for the dog. However, they are objectionable to owners if shown to excess or in an inappropriate context, particularly in a sexually altered dog. \u2022 Normal behaviors with multiple causes\u2014may be maladaptive owing to stimuli in the environment. \u2022 Marking\u2014generates a signal for conspecifics with a visual mark, scent (urine, feces, anal sacs, or sebaceous glands) or both on an object or to define territory. \u2022 Roaming\u2014wandering from territory for exploration or in search of mates, food, or social contact. \u2022 Mounting\u2014 primarily a component of mating behavior but also shown in social contexts and play (especially in prepubertal dogs).

Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Typically unremarkable unless a medical etiology is suspected (especially for marking behavior). \u2022 For inappropriate mounting of other dogs, it is advisable to also perform a physical examination on the target animal. CAUSES \u2022 Normal behaviors. Urine marking occurs most commonly in novel areas. Female dogs rarely mark in the home. \u2022 Hormonally regulated; intact males likely to roam, mark, and mount; prenatal testosterone surge leads to the brain\u2019s response to testosterone at puberty (i.e., sexual dimorphic behavior). \u2022 Learned components possible; reproductive status not sole variable. Roaming \u2022 Anxiety. \u2022 Curiosity. \u2022 Reproduction. \u2022 Social contact and play.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Histamine release from mast cell tumors (MCTs) affects a multitude of tissues. \u2022 Histamine (H2) receptors are primarily located within the stomach and histamine is thought to be one of the most significant stimulants of gastric acid secretion in addition to gastrin and acetylcholine. \u2022 In extreme cases, perforation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may occur, leading to peritonitis. \u2022 Histamine release around a tumor leads to the production of wheals, hives, and erythema (Darier\u2019s flare). \u2022 Local release of heparin is also common, resulting in bleeding and subsequent bruising, which can be seen around the tumor. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Skin\u2014MCTs are the most common malignant cutaneous tumor of the dog. \u2022 GI\u2014on necropsy evaluation, 35\u201383% of dogs with MCTs have evidence of GI ulceration. \u2022 Hemic/lymph/immune\u2014 regional lymph node metastasis is common in high\u00adgrade tumors. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014liver and spleen are common distant sites of metastasis for high\u00adgrade MCTs.

The latter is more common in dogs, the former in cats. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The pathophysiology of one type of excessive maternal behavior, pseudocyesis, appears to be elevated progesterone levels following estrus in unbred bitches followed by an abrupt drop in progesterone levels. The pathophysiology of the refusal to accept puppies by females after caesarean section is the waning of factors, including oxytocin, needed during the sensitive period for acceptance of the neonate. The pathophysiology of other types of deficient maternal behavior is unknown. The impairment or absence of mother\u2013infant bonding strongly affects the offspring\u2019s sociability or affiliative behavior throughout the animal\u2019s lifespan. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral. \u2022 Reproductive. GENETICS There is no identified genetic predisposition, but a breed disposition for deficient maternal behavior in Jack Russell terriers indicates there may be a genetic component. There are genetic models in mice. The genes responsible for deficient maternal behavior in mice are paternally imprinted. If this is true in dogs and cats, one would expect that rejecting mothers were normally mothered themselves, but their paternal grandmother may have been deficient. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE The incidence of deficient maternal behavior has not been determined but seems to be low, less than 1% of cases in a behavior practice. Pseudopregnancy is more common. Cannibalism of offspring is more common in cats and may account for approximately 12.5% of all kitten deaths. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats. Breed Predilections Poor maternal behavior may be more common in Jack Russell terriers and cocker spaniels, but there has been no quantitative study. Mean Age and Range Primiparous females and older bitches seem to be at risk of deficient maternal behavior. Lower ranking females that have not bred successfully have a higher likelihood of entering pseudocyesis, which may allow for them to help raise the offspring. Predominant Sex Female generally, but some males may allow suckling behavior. SIGNS Deficient Maternal Behavior Absent maternal behavior; the mother simply abandons her offspring. This is most apt to occur after caesarean section. Poor Maternal Behavior \u2022 The mother stays with her offspring but will not allow them to nurse. \u2022 The mother may show inadequate retrieval of young, insufficient cleaning of the young, or failure to stimulate elimination. \u2022 The bitch carries the puppies from place to place without settling down. \u2022 In the most extreme form, the mother kills some or all of her litter. Abnormal Maternal Behavior \u2022 The bitch or queen may allow her offspring to suckle but kills her offspring either at birth or over a period of days. Occasionally the bitch, or more rarely the queen, will abandon or attack her offspring if it has changed in odor or appearance. A female may be disturbed by another animal or by people and can redirect her aggression to her offspring. \u2022 Cannibalism of kittens may occur as a result of too large a litter or overcrowding. \u2022 A bitch may accidentally disembowel or even consume offspring completely while eating the fetal membranes and umbilical cord. This should be distinguished from normal licking, which can be quite vigorous, even dislodging the pup from a teat. Maternal Aggression Cats with kittens may be aggressive to other animals, especially dogs in the same household. Bitches may be aggressive to unfamiliar humans or even to familiar humans, especially if they are hypocalcemic or painful (i.e., mastitis). Excessive Maternal Behavior \u2022 The pseudopregnant bitch or a bitch spayed during the late luteal phase of the estrous cycle adopts, attempts to nurse, and guards inanimate objects (stuffed animals or even leashes). The pseudopregnant bitch may have mammary development and may lactate. \u2022 The newly spayed queen may steal kittens from a lactating queen. Queens post\u00adspaying may also lactate if suckled. CAUSES \u2022 Genetics\u2014offspring of poor mothers. \u2022 Sick/unhealthy offspring. \u2022 Environmental (see Risk Factors). RISK FACTORS \u2022 The presence of kittens in the environment of the recently spayed cat may prompt excessive maternal behavior and kitten stealing. \u2022 The risk of excessive carrying of pups, redirected aggression, or even cannibalism is increased if there are other dogs or too many people present in the nest area. \u2022 Primiparous females or those subjected to caesarian section are at higher risk than multiparous or naturally delivering females. \u2022 A large litter of kittens or sick offspring. \u2022 Queens fed low protein diets during late gestation and lactation may show decreased mother\u2013kitten social interactions and retarded attachment formation. \u2022 Other risk factors include individual differences, lack of experience, pain, discomfort, and suboptimal conditions. \u2022 Inability to perform species\u00adspecific behavior before, during, and after parturition increases the possibility of infanticide or ingestion of offspring.", "Maxillary and Mandibular Fractures": " Fractures of the mandibles, maxillae, and associated structures are described according to location, severity (i.e., tooth involvement, soft tissue tears, and type of bone fracture), and effects of the muscles of mastication on reduction.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Idiopathic dilated megacolon is the most common cause of chronic constipation in cats and occurs due to generalized colonic smooth muscle dysfunction. \u2022 The diagnosis of idio- pathic dilated megacolon is often preceded by chronic, recurrent constipation so it is unclear whether a primary disorder of colonic smooth muscle occurs first or whether smooth muscle dysfunction results from prolonged colonic distension. \u2022 Megacolon can also occur secondary to abnormal neurologic function of the colon, including dysautonomia, spinal cord injury or deformities, pelvic nerve injury, and autonomic ganglioneuritis. \u2022 Colonic aganglionosis/hypoganglionosis (Hirschsprung\u2019s disease in humans) is a congenital absence of ganglia in the colonic smooth muscle; affected segments are unable to relax, resulting in megacolon. \u2022 Hypertrophic megacolon can develop as a consequence of obstructive lesions and will progress to dilated megacolon if the obstruction is not corrected. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal. \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014 concurrent neurologic abnormalities may be seen when megacolon has a neurogenic cause. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014megacolon can occur secondary to pelvic fractures. \u2022 Endocrine/ metabolic\u2014megacolon can result in electrolyte derangements due to prolonged vomiting.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In the normal esophagus, the presence of a food bolus in the proximal esophagus stimulates afferent sensory neurons. \u2022 Signals are transferred centrally, via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the tractus solitarius and nucleus ambiguus. \u2022 Motor impulses travel back via the efferent neurons of the vagus nerve to stimulate striated muscle (canine) and striated and smooth muscle (feline) esophageal contraction. \u2022 Lesions anywhere along this pathway may lead to megaesophagus and resultant retention of food and liquids. \u2022 Approximately 60% of dogs with megaesophagus have an \u201cachalasialike\u201d syndrome of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that is a well-documented cause of megaesophagus in people. \u2022 Functional obstruction of the LES results in esophageal dilatation, retention of ingesta, loss of esophageal motility, and associated clinical signs of esophageal dysphagia. \u2022 Dogs with evidence of esophageal achalasia may respond to targeted therapy with subsequent improvement in esophageal dysphagia. \u2022 Focal megaesophagus is typically caused by esophageal obstruction secondary to strictures or a vascular ring anomaly with dilation of the esophagus proximal to the obstruction.

GENETICS \u2022 Congenital form\u2014megaesophagus can be inherited in smooth fox terriers (autosomal recessive) and miniature schnauzers (autosomal dominant or 60% penetrance autosomal recessive). In addition, Jack Russell terriers, springer spaniels, long-haired miniature dachshunds, golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and Samoyeds are predisposed to the congenital form of myasthenia gravis. \u2022 Other breeds in which acquired megaesophagus is more commonly reported include German shepherd dog, Great Dane, Irish setter, Labrador retriever, pug, and Chinese Shar-Pei. \u2022 Acquired form\u2014many diseases, especially neuromuscular diseases, may have an association with megaesophagus.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 About 3% of hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin each day in normal animals as a result of autoxidation of hemoglobin or secondary to oxidants produced in normal metabolic reactions. \u2022 Methemoglobin usually accounts for <1% of total hemoglobin, because it is constantly reduced back to hemoglobin by an NADHdependent cytochrome b 5 reductase (methemoglobin reductase) enzyme reaction within red blood cells (RBCs). \u2022 Caused by either increased production of methemoglobin by oxidants or decreased reduction of methemoglobin associated with a deficiency of the RBC cytochrome b 5 reductase enzyme or defective cytochrome b 5 . SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, because methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen; if methemoglobin content reaches high values (e.g., > 50% of total hemoglobin), organs may suffer hypoxic injury. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014in addition to hypoxic injury, the liver may be damaged directly by oxidant drugs that it metabolizes. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014in addition to hypoxic injury, the kidneys may be damaged if intravascular hemolysis occurs (pigmentary nephropathy). SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs and cats. \u2022 Deficiency in RBC cytochrome b 5 reductase has been recognized in the Chihuahua, borzoi, English setter, mixed-breed dog, coonhound, poodle, corgi, Pomeranian, Staffordshire bull terrier, Parson Russell terrier, Australian shepherd dog, and American Eskimo dog, and in domestic shorthair cats. A defect in cytochrome b 5 has been described in a mixed-breed dog.

Caused by Associated Diseases \u2022 Vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea possible in patients with drug toxicity. \u2022 Hemoglobinuria secondary to severe intravascular hemolysis in some patients with Heinz body hemolytic anemia. \u2022 Subcutaneous edema, especially involving the face, and salivation in animals with acetaminophen toxicity. CAUSES \u2022 Toxicity\u2014acetaminophen, benzocaine, phenazopyridine, and skunk musk cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia; excess nitrite in pet food and hydroxycarbamide toxicity are reported to cause methemoglobinemia without Heinz body hemolytic anemia. \u2022 Deficiency in RBC cytochrome b 5 reductase or a defect in RBC cytochrome b 5 . RISK FACTORS \u2022 Application of benzocaine or prilocaine to traumatized skin or mucous membranes increases the likelihood of systemic absorption and methemoglobinemia. \u2022 Cats are much more likely to develop clinically significant methemoglobinemia than are dogs after acetaminophen administration; this drug is not recommended for use in cats. \u2022 Methemoglobinemia secondary to cytochrome b 5 reductase deficiency and a defect in cytochrome b are inherited disorders.", "Metritis": " \u2022 Bacterial uterine infection that develops in the immediate postpartum period (usually within the first week); occasionally develops after an abortion or nonsterile artificial insemination\u2014rarely after natural breeding. \u2022 Bacteria\u2014ascend through the open cervix to the uterus; postpartum uterus provides an ideal environment for growth; Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli ) commonly isolated. \u2022 Potentially life-threatening infection; may lead to septic shock. \u2022 Can become chronic and lead to infertility.

Multidrugresistant (MDR) infections are those that are resistant to more than one class of antimicrobials. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AMR can develop in several ways: \u2022 Use of antimicrobials creates selection pressure, allowing growth of bacteria resistant to a specific drug by decreasing competition with susceptible organisms. \u2022 Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can share genetic elements, conferring resistance to other bacteria. \u2022 Spontaneous new mutations can develop that allow bacterial survival in the face of antimicrobials. \u2022 MDR infections occur through any of these mechanisms; resistance is often additive with antimicrobial use over time.

RISK FACTORS Cardiac disease.", "Muscle Rupture (Muscle Tear)": " A normal muscle may be stretched, pinched, or injured directly, resulting in fiber disruption, weakening, and immediate or delayed separation of the uninjured portions. Alternatively, the muscle structure may be compromised by systemic or iatrogenic conditions, and normal activity may cause muscle disruption. The rupture may be complete or incomplete, and it may be mid-substance or at the muscle\u2013tendon junction. The acute stage is characterized by a typical inflammatory reaction that becomes chronic with collagen maturation, crosslinking, fibrosis, and adhesion development over time. Frequently the acute phase is overlooked, as the signs may be temporary and respond well to rest. The chronic effects are often progressive and unresponsive to support therapies. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Limb and masticatory muscles are the primary structures affected. \u2022 Traumatic injury is indiscriminate, although certain activities may predispose because of exposure. \u2022 The ruptures that are apparently unrelated to trauma seem to affect middle-aged to older working dogs, with no reported sex predilection. \u2022 Cats are affected less frequently than dogs. SIGNS Acute Injury \u2022 Immediate lameness that is characterized by the specific muscle affected. \u2022 Localized swelling, heat, and pain. \u2022 Generally present for a few days to a week. \u2022 Animals may experience re-injury.

Rapid -Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Russula subnigricans . Delayed-Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Tricholoma equestre . Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Antagonist Mushroom Poisoning Gyrometra genus (many species; false morels). Gastrointestinal (GI) Irritant Mushroom Poisoning A wide variety of mushrooms can induce GI irritation when ingested. \u2022 Paxillus syndrome: Paxillus involutus (brown roll-rim, poisonous paxillus, brown chantarelle, roll-rim fungus). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Cytotoxic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major toxins are amatoxins (bicyclic octapeptides with an indole-( R )-sulfoxide bridge), phallotoxins (cyclic heptapeptides with an indole/thio-etherbridge), and/or virotoxins (heptapeptides have a monocyclic structure, this includes 2-methylsulfonyltryptophan or 2-methylsulfoxytryptophan and dihydroxyproline). \u2022 Critically, amatoxins are heat stable and not inactivated by cooking. \u2022 Phallotoxins do not cause poisoning when ingested. \u2022 The major mode of action is inhibition of RNA polymerase II, resulting in cell death. Primary Acute Nephrotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Major toxin is aminohexadienoic acid, which produces rapid-onset (latent period of 30 minutes to 12 hours), fulminant nephrotoxicity. Delayed Nephrotoxic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major toxins are orellanine and orelline. \u2022 Inhibit DNA and RNA polymerases. \u2022 A typical C. orellanus mushroom contains 15\u201320 mg of orellanine. Hallucinogenic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major toxins are psilocybin and psilocin; psilocybin is a pro-toxin which is metabolized to the active toxin psilocin. \u2022 Purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms may be laced with LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), phencyclidine, and/ or ketamine. \u2022 Hallucinogenic mushrooms are often incorporated into bars of chocolate to aid ingestion (the mushrooms often have an astringent taste). Autonomic Toxicity Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major toxin is l-(+)-muscarine. \u2022 Other muscarine enantiomers are commonly present but are much less potent and less important in cases of poisoning. \u2022 l-(+)-Muscarine forms a very stable chlorine salt. \u2022 Heating, boiling, and drying does not inactivate the toxin. \u2022 Clinical signs reflect muscarinic parasympathetic nervous system stimulation and a muscarinic cholinergic crisis. Psychoactive Isoxazole Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major toxins are ibotenic acid and its decarboxylated derivative muscimol. \u2022 Act as GABA antagonists. \u2022 Muscarine is present in small amounts. \u2022 A. pantherina may also contain amatoxins; however, hepatotoxicity with this species appears to be very rare. Rapid-Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 The major myotoxin is cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid. \u2022 A number of other cytotoxic toxins (russuphelins) have been identified. \u2022 Mushroom also contains a gastrointestinal toxin and cadmium. Delayed-Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Major toxins are unknown. GABA Antagonist Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Major pro-toxin is gyromitrin. \u2022 In the digestive tract gyromitrin forms monomethylhydrazine, the ultimate toxin. \u2022 Monomethylhydrazine reacts with pyridoxal-5-phosphate forming a hydrozone, which decreases glutamic acid decarboxylase activity and decreases formation of GABA. \u2022 Gyromitrin also forms methyl- N -formylhydrazine, which is hepatotoxic. \u2022 Gyromitrin is a carcinogen. \u2022 Uncooked or partially cooked mushrooms have a higher toxicity than fully cooked mushrooms (gyromitrin is volatile). GI Irritant Mushroom Poisoning A diverse array of toxins is involved but they produce clinically similar effects. Paxillus Syndrome \u2022 Major toxins include involutin (a diphenylcyclopenteneone compound). \u2022 An antigen of an unknown structure in the fungus stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In subsequent meals the antigen\u2013antibody complexes are formed and become attached to the surface of erythrocytes, causing their agglutination and hemolysis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cytotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Intestine, liver and kidneys; pancreatitis reported with A. phalloides ; cellular injury is widespread, but typically the liver is the major target organ.

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide; classically fruiting occurs during spring to autumn. SIGNS Cytotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Patients commonly presented with fulminant hepatic failure or found dead with fulminant hepatic failure of \u201cunknown origin\u201d identified during necropsy. The classical clinical course occurs over a 7-day period: \u2022 Day 1: Mushroom meal and symptom-free interval (6\u201312 hours). \u2022 Day 2: GI phase with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea. \u2022 Day 3: Apparent symptomatic remission, but laboratory evidence of developing liver damage. \u2022 Day 4: Coagulopathy develops and GI bleeding commences. \u2022 Day 5: Onset of hepatic encephalopathy, onset of hepatic coma. \u2022 Day 6: Renal failure. \u2022 Day 7: Death. Primary Acute Nephrotoxic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Rapid-onset, acute, fulminant renal failure with a 30-minute to 12-hour post-ingestion latency period. \u2022 Clinical presentation resembles nonspecific acute renal failure. Delayed Nephrotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Delayed-onset, acute, fulminant renal failure with a 36-hour to 17-day post-ingestion latency period. Hallucinogenic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Latency is typically 10\u201330 minutes post ingestion. \u2022 Clinical signs reflect auditory, visual (e.g., biting at invisible flies) or tactile hallucinations with the degree of clinical signs being dose-dependent. \u2022 Most CNS reactions are euphoric or excitatory; however, aggression can be enhanced in some cases. \u2022 Clinical signs attributable to anxiety, agitation, and ataxia may occur. \u2022 Other effects include pupillary dilation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, yawning, parasthesiae, hyperreflexia, tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemic effects. \u2022 Convulsions can occur, but are more likely in young animals. \u2022 CNS depression can occur late in the clinical course. \u2022 For unadulterated mushrooms the clinical course is typically less than 1 hour; if longer than this ingestion of LSD and/or phencyclidine (effects may last >12 hours) should be considered. \u2022 Beware \u2014ongoing convulsive episodes, myocardial ischemia, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis are possible, particularly with adulterated mushrooms. Autonomic Toxicity Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Onset is typically 15 minutes to 2 hours post ingestion. \u2022 The clinical course is dose-dependent: about 2 hours in mild cases and up to 1 day in more severe cases. \u2022 Remember : DUMBELS\u2014 diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia/ bronchorrhea/bronchoconstriction, emesis, lacrimation, and salivation. \u2022 Impaired sight due to impaired accommodation. \u2022 Hypotension, vasodilation, and circulatory shock may occur. Psychoactive Isoxazole Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Onset is typically within minutes to 3 hours post ingestion. \u2022 The typical clinical course is an initial period of drowsiness followed by a period of manic excitement with visual hallucinations (e.g. biting at invisible flies) and bizarre behavior lasting up to 48 hours. This is then followed by a period of deep CNS depression during which intense dreaming has been reported in humans. \u2022 Ataxia, incoordination, dizziness, mydriasis, myoclonus, muscle fasciculation/tremors, hyporeflexia, coma, and convulsions (in severe poisoning) can occur. \u2022 Rarely vomiting and/or diarrhea can occur Rapid-Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Onset is typically within 2 hours post ingestion. \u2022 The initial phase (2\u201324 hours post ingestion) consists of acute gastroenteritis which may resolve over the next 24 hours. \u2022 The later phase, developing around 6\u201312 hours post ingestion, consists of muscle pain, myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, hypertension, dehydration, renal failure, hyperkalemia, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cardiovascular collapse. \u2022 Respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, ventricular tachycardia, and circulatory shock have been recorded in humans. \u2022 In fatal cases, death ensues within 12\u201324 hours post ingestion. Delayed-Onset Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning Resembles acute myotoxic poisoning except onset is delayed typically for 24 hours with resolution over about 15 days in survivors. GABA Antagonist Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Onset is unpredictable. \u2022 Most cases result in mild, self-limiting GI disturbance starting 6\u201312 hours post ingestion. \u2022 Cases of severe poisoning may or may not present with an initial GI upset phase followed by hepatorenal toxicity plus neurological disturbance (seizures, mydriasis, muscle fasciculations progressing to coma). Multiorgan failure is common in severe cases. \u2022 Methemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria occurs in some cases. \u2022 Hydrazines also affect the cross-linking of collagen and have been associated with dissecting aortic aneurysms. GI Irritant Mushroom Poisoning \u2022 Onset is typically 1\u20133 hours post ingestion. \u2022 Clinical signs include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. \u2022 Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can be severe, particularly in small animals. \u2022 Disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure can occur. \u2022 GI upset is usually short and self-limiting. Paxillus Syndrome \u2022 Self-limiting GI upset. \u2022 Immune mediate hemolytic anemia. \u2022 Sensitivity to the mushroom builds up with repeated ingestion over a period of years.", "Myasthenia Gravis": " A disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterized by muscular weakness and excessive fatigability. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Transmission failure at the neuromuscular junction\u2014results from structural or functional abnormalities of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or other end-plate proteins and enzymes (congenital form) and from autoantibody-mediated destruction of AChRs and postsynaptic membranes (acquired form). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014result of abnormalities or destruction of AChRs, choline acetyltransferase or end-plate cholinesterase. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014may find aspiration pneumonia secondary to megaesophagus.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Tuberculosis \u2022 Source of exposure\u2014always an infected typical host. \u2022 Dogs\u2014usually from an infected person in the household ( M. tuberculosis ); route is ingestion of expectorated infectious material; aerosol exposure; patients often found in urban areas with newly arrived immigrants. \u2022 Cats\u2014classically exposed by drinking unpasteurized milk of infected cattle ( M. bovis ); much less common now; may be exposed by predation on infected small mammals ( M. bovis , undefined tuberculosis species). Feline Leprosy \u2022 Syndrome 1\u2014cases have been reported from temperate coastal areas and port cities; cool climate may facilitate growth of the organism in extremities. \u2022 Syndrome 2\u2014cases are from rural environments; old age or immune-incompetence may be a risk factor; exact risk factors remain undefined; exposure to rodents postulated.

Mycobacterial Panniculitis \u2022 Infections usually have antecedent trauma or surgical wound; most patients are immune- competent. \u2022 Trauma and accidental inoculation of the subcutaneous fat results in infection; history of bite wound possible (subcutaneous disease). \u2022 Overweight of obese animals are more at risk.", "Mycoplasmosis": " \u2022 Class Mollicutes. \u2022 Divided into hemotropic (formerly Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon, see: Hemotropic Mycoplasmosis) and nonhemotropic types (discussed here). \u2022 More than 80 genera, three families: Mycoplasmas, Ureaplasmas, and Acholeplasmas. \u2022 Smallest (0.2\u20130.3 \u03bc m) and simplest prokaryotic cells capable of self\u2010replication. \u2022 Fastidious, facultative anaerobic, Gramnegative rods. \u2022 Lack cell wall; thus plastic, highly pleomorphic, fragile and sensitive to lysis by osmotic shock, detergents, alcohols, and specific antibody plus complement. Enclosed by a trilayered cell membrane built of amphipathic lipids and proteins; therefore resistant to lysozyme and cell wall\u2010inhibiting antibacterials; most require sterols for growth. \u2022 Reproduce by binary fission; genome replication not necessarily synchronized with cell division, resulting in budding forms and chains of beads. \u2022 Small genome (0.6\u20131.6 Mb), believed to be result of reductive evolution from a common Gram\u2010positive ancestor adapting to obligate parasitic life. \u2022 Ubiquitous in nature as parasites, commensals, or saprophytes in animals, plants, and insects; many are pathogens of humans, animals, plants, and insects. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Often part of the resident flora as commensals on mucous membranes of the upper respiratory, digestive, and genital tracts; pathogenicity and role in disease often controversial. \u2022 Species show considerable host specificity. \u2022 Mechanisms by which disease is caused are poorly understood. \u2022 Some species attach to cells by specific receptors; small size and plastic nature enable them to adapt to the shape and contours of host cell surfaces. \u2022 Intimate contact with host cells\u2014necessary for assimilation of vital nutrients and growth factors which organism cannot synthesize. This, along with the tendency of exogenous proteins to bind to mycoplasmal membrane may allow organism to evade the host\u2019s immune response. May incorporate host cell antigen onto mycoplasma membrane (capping) because of lack of cell wall. Conversely, mycoplasmal protein antigen may become incorporated onto surface of host cell, involving host cell in deleterious immunologic reactions intended against the organism. \u2022 Products produced during growth\u2014 capsular carbohydrate, hemolysins, proteolytic enzymes, ammonia, and endonucleases; accumulation of Mycoplasma metabolites (i.e., H 2 O 2 , NH 3 ) may contribute to cytopathic effects and tissue damage; cytotoxic glycoproteins and proteins have been isolated from the membranes of several species. \u2022 Immune response\u2014predominantly humoral; as with bacterial infections, IgM and IgA are first antibodies to appear, followed by IgG. \u2022 Fibrinous exudate accompanying infections\u2014protects organism from antibodies and antimicrobial drugs; contributes to chronicity. \u2022 Secondary bacterial invaders\u2014common (e.g., attachment to respiratory tract cells results in destruction of cilia, which predisposes patient to secondary bacterial infection). \u2022 Sialidase, a virulence factor that promotes colonization, tissue invasion, and damage to host cells\u2014varies in expression among strains of canine mycoplasma species.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Unknown", "Myocarditis": " \u2022 Inflammation of the myocardium, definitive identification of which requires histologic examination. \u2022 In humans, the widely accepted Dallas criteria specify that necrosis and/or degeneration of myocytes adjacent to inflammatory infiltrates is a requisite for diagnosis. \u2022 Causes are diverse and include infective (viral, bacterial, protozoal, mycotic) pathogens and noninfective (toxic, possibly immune) disease agents. \u2022 Traumatic myocarditis is a term applied to the syndrome of arrhythmias that sometimes complicates blunt trauma. The term is a misnomer because myocardial lesions (if present) are more likely to take the form of necrosis than inflammation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Numerous mechanisms, determined partly by the nature of the causative agent, are implicated. \u2022 Microbial agents and toxins can result in direct cellular damage causing cell death, activation of the immune system, and inflammation. \u2022 Though incompletely described in veterinary patients, chronic myocarditis, immune myocarditis and autoreactive myocarditis\u2014the latter occurring in the absence of microbial agents\u2014as well as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are potential sequelae of acute myocarditis. \u2022 The cellular character of inflammation is partly determined by the nature of the pathologic insult; protozoal and mycotic agents result in pyogranulomatous infiltrates, while viral myocarditis is generally lymphocytic. \u2022 Myocardial involvement may be focal or diffuse. \u2022 Canine parvoviral infection can result in myocarditis in pups, and has been implicated as a cause of DCM. The virus has tropism for dividing cells, and adult myocytes do not replicate. Parvovirus myocarditis is most likely to occur in unvaccinated pups from immunologically na\u00efve dams. \u2022 Protozoal myocarditis resulting from Trypanosoma cruzi infection causes Chagas disease. Acute phase illness is characterized primarily by electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. Chronic infection can result in myocardial dysfunction and development of heart failure. \u2022 It has been hypothesized that feline endomyocarditis might be a precursor of restrictive cardiomyopathy; recent findings implicate infection by Bartonella spp. \u2022 Bacterial myocarditis can be observed in patients with overwhelming sepsis. \u2022 Bacterial, protozoal, and mycotic myocarditis may reflect immunosuppression. \u2022 An apparently rare, as yet idiopathic, atrial myocarditis might be important in the pathogenesis of persistent canine atrial standstill. \u2022 The pathogenetic importance of myocardial inflammation in canine arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is unresolved; however, myocarditis is observed in a substantial proportion of cases. \u2022 The pathogenesis of traumatic myocarditis is incompletely defined; direct trauma resulting in necrosis is likely responsible in some cases, but extracardiac factors including electrolyte derangements, hypoxia, acid\u2013base disturbances, and altered function of the autonomic nervous system might contribute. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Systemic involvement depends on the causative agent. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014 myocardial dysfunction and/or arrhythmias. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014if pulmonary edema develops. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Histologically confirmed myocarditis is rarely identified in veterinary patients, therefore epidemiology of myocarditis is incompletely described. \u2022 Viral myocarditis is seemingly rare. \u2022 Chagas disease is uncommon and occurs primarily in the southern United States. \u2022 Fungal myocarditis\u2014 primarily seen in association with systemic fungal infection\u2014is rare and occurs regionally, where mycoses are endemic. \u2022 Spirochetal myocarditis and atrioventricular (AV) block resulting from Borrelia burgdorferi infection has been reported, but seemingly is rare. \u2022 Infection by Bartonella spp. has been associated with canine and feline myocarditis. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Myocarditis can result from infectious agents that have distinct geographic distributions. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Mean Age and Range Largely unknown. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Related to the extent and duration of myocardial involvement. \u2022 Signs relating to arrhythmias or heart failure are most common. \u2022 Onset of cardiac dysfunction in association with systemic illness should prompt consideration of myocarditis and, because myocardial disease in veterinary patients is often familial, development of cardiac dysfunction in patients with atypical signalment suggests the possibility of myocarditis. Historical Findings \u2022 Coughing, exercise intolerance, dyspnea\u2014 associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). \u2022 Syncope and weakness\u2014associated with arrhythmias. \u2022 Concurrent manifestations of systemic disease reflective of the etiologic agent. \u2022 Road traffic or other accidents often precede the development of traumatic myocarditis.

Most muscular dystrophies are due to mutations in genes that code for muscle membrane associated proteins in the dystrophin\u2013 glycoprotein (DAG) complex. \u2022 Most common form in dogs occurs as a result of a deficiency of the protein dystrophin. \u2022 Muscular dystrophy due to dystrophin deficiency has an X-linked mode of inheritance and affected animals are predominantly male. \u2022 Dystrophin deficiency\u2014identified first in golden retrievers. Subsequently, cases have been reported in many other dog breeds. Sporadic cases in other breeds are likely. \u2022 The dystrophin gene is large and new mutations are likely to occur. \u2022 Hypertrophic muscular dystrophy associated with dystrophin deficiency also occurs in domestic shorthair cats. \u2022 Deficiency of other muscle-associated proteins, e.g., alpha2 laminin (merosin) and sarcoglycan, has been identified more recently in dogs and cats and is not necessarily X-linked (females affected). \u2022 A myopathy associated with loss of alpha-dystroglycan with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance occurs in young Devon Rex and Sphynx cats. Alpha- dystroglycan expression, which is associated with COLQ anchorage at the motor end-plate, has been shown to be deficient in affected cats, resulting in a congenital myasthenic syndrome. \u2022 Unclassified muscular dystrophies have also been reported in other dogs (males and females).

These signs have been reported in dogs, but most do not present with all of them. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Myxedema coma results from chronic untreated severe primary hypothyroidism. \u2022 Both forms of primary hypothyroidism (lymphocytic thyroiditis and idiopathic thyroid atrophy) have been associated with the development of myxedema coma. \u2022 A secondary precipitating event is usually associated with the onset of a myxedema crisis. \u2022 Precipitating events can include infections, respiratory disease, heart failure, and hypo - volemia. \u2022 Exposure to cold temperatures may be a precipitating event.", "Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease": " Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is characterized by progressive myxomatous degeneration, which refers to a characteristic pathologic weakening and disorganization of valvular connective tissue. Although myxomatous degeneration most commonly affects the mitral valve, any of the four intracardiac valves can be affected, and the most commonly used descriptor \u201cmitral\u201d does not exclude involvement of other valves. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Pathologic weakened and disorganized valvular connective tissue, in which the spongiosa component is unusually prominent with accumulation of mucopolysaccarides and glycosaminoglycans. \u2022 Valve leaflets become thickened and elongated with disease progression. \u2022 Degenerative changes in chordae tendineae lead to thickening and elongation of these structures, thus contributing to valve flattening and prolapse. \u2022 With progression, valve lesions cause insufficient systolic coaptation of the leaflets, leading to backward regurgitation of blood from the ventricle into the atrium. \u2022 Severity of mitral regurgitation depends on severity of valve lesions (leaflets and/or chordae tendineae). \u2022 Compensatory mechanisms include cardiac dilation and eccentric hypertrophy, increased force of contraction, increased heart rate, increased pulmonary lymphatic drainage, fluid retention, and neurohormonal modulation of cardiovascular function. \u2022 With progression, valvular regurgitation eventually may not be compensated, leading to reduced cardiac output and increased venous pressures, leading to pulmonary edema if left\u00adsided congestive heart failure (CHF) and ascites if right\u00adsided CHF. \u2022 Acute cardiac tamponade may result from atrial tear. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014myxomatous degeneration most commonly affects the mitral valve but any intracardiac valve can be affected. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014passive congestion at advanced stages. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014prerenal azotemia at advanced stages. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014 if edema and/or pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops. GENETICS Etiology currently unknown, but the current leading scientific hypothesis is that a genetically determined dystrophic process initiates valve degeneration. Age of onset is inherited as a polygenetic threshold trait (i.e., multiple genes influence the trait and a certain threshold has to be reached before the disease develops). This mode of inheritance means that a combination of a sire and a dam that both have an early onset of MMVD will give offspring that have, on average, an early onset of the disease. A combination of dogs with late onset will give offspring that manifest the disease at old age or never. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE The most common cardiac disease in dogs. Prevalence is strongly influenced by age: it is uncommon in young dogs but common in old dogs. MMVD is encountered in all breeds, but the highest prevalence is seen in small to medium\u00adsized dog breeds. The prevalence reaches >90% in some affected dog breeds >10 years. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs; extremely rare in cats. Breed Predilections Typically small breeds (<20 kg, but may be encountered in larger dogs), such as cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS), Chihuahua, miniature schnauzer, Maltese terrier, Pomeranian, cocker spaniel, Pekingese, poodle, and others. Mean Age and Range Murmur may be detected from 2 years of age with a peak incidence for detection at 6\u20138 years in widely affected breeds such as the CKCS. Onset of CHF from 8\u201312 years. Predominant Sex Males develop the disease at a younger age than females, which means higher prevalence at a given age in males, SIGNS Signs depend on the stage of disease. The descriptions here align with the grading system described in the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) consensus statement on MMVD. Clinically Healthy Patients but at a Higher Risk of Developing the Disease (ACVIM Stage A) No abnormal findings. Dogs Diagnosed with the Disease but with No Overt Clinical Signs (ACVIM Stage B) \u2022 Systolic click (early stage). \u2022 Systolic murmur best heard over the mitral or tricuspid areas. \u2022 Murmurs may range from soft low\u00adintensity to loud holosystolic. \u2022 With progression, murmurs typically get louder and radiate more widely. \u2022 Initially, patients have no obvious radiographic or echocardiographic changes in cardiac chamber size or have mild cardiomegaly and do not meet the so called \u201cEPIC trial criteria\u201d (see ACVIM stage B1). Stage B2 is defined as dogs with cardiac enlargement meeting EPIC trial criteria, i.e., presenting a moderate or loud intensity murmur (\u22653/6), VHS >10.5, bodyweight normalized left ventricular end\u00addiastolic diameter (LVIDDn) \u22651,7, and a left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) \u22651.6.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Raw meat may be a risk factor; should be avoided.", "Nephrolithiasis": " \u2022 Nephroliths\u2014uroliths located in the renal pelvis or collecting diverticula of the kidney. \u2022 Nephroliths or nephrolith fragments may pass into the ureters (ureteroliths). \u2022 Nephroliths that are not infected, causing obstruction or clinical signs, or progressively enlarging are termed incidental nephroliths. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Nephroliths can obstruct the renal pelvis or ureter, predispose to pyelonephritis, and lead to compressive injury of the renal parenchyma and chronic kidney disease (CKD); see urolithiasis chapters for pathophysiology. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014affects the urinary tract, with potential for obstruction, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), or progressive CKD. \u2022 Obstruction of the renal pelvis or ureter with pyelonephritis may result in septicemia and affect any body system. GENETICS See specific chapter on type of stone. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Nephroliths comprise 1\u20131.5% of uroliths submitted to the Minnesota Urolith Center for analysis. The true incidence of nephroliths is likely higher. Many animals with nephroliths are asymptomatic, or are not treated by methods that allow retrieval of uroliths for analysis. \u2022 Composition of canine nephroliths submitted for analysis, in descending frequency: calcium oxalate, struvite, compound, purines, calcium phosphate, cystine, and silica. Composition of nephroliths in cats (descending frequency): calcium oxalate, dried solidified blood calculi, compound, struvite, calcium phosphate, and purine. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat.

Predominant Sex \u2022 Dogs\u2014nephroliths slightly more common in females than males; struvite nephroliths, females > males; however, calcium oxalate, cystine, and urate nephroliths males > females. \u2022 Cat\u2014 nephroliths slightly more common in females than males; for calcium oxalate females > males; however, noncrystalline matrix (includes dried blood), and urate nephroliths males > females. SIGNS General Comments Many patients are asymptomatic, and the nephroliths are diagnosed during evaluation of other problems. Historical Findings \u2022 None or hematuria, vomiting, and recurrent UTI; dysuria and pollakiuria in animals with UTI or concomitant urocystoliths. \u2022 Uremia in animals with bilateral obstruction or nonfunctional contralateral kidney. \u2022 Signs referable to lower urinary tract urolithiasis if uroliths are present in the upper and lower urinary tract. \u2022 Renal colic with acute abdominal/lumbar pain and vomiting is possible. Physical Examination Findings Abdominal or lumbar pain upon palpation of kidneys or no significant findings. CAUSES See chapters on each urolithiasis.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Alkaluria\u2014struvite and calcium phosphate uroliths. \u2022 Aciduria\u2014calcium oxalate, cystine, urate, and xanthine uroliths. \u2022 Urine retention and formation of highly concentrated urine. \u2022 Lower UTI\u2014ascending infection and pyelonephritis. \u2022 Conditions that predispose to UTI.", "Nephrotic Syndrome": " Concurrent proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and third-space fluid accumulation (i.e., ascites, subcutaneous edema, etc.). Partial nephrotic syndrome refers to proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia without fluid accumulation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Magnitude of hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria causing nephrotic syndrome in dogs and cats is unknown; although affected patients usually have very low serum albumin concentrations, not all hypoalbuminemic patients will develop nephrotic syndrome. \u2022 Reduced plasma oncotic pressure may result in hyperaldosteronism, which induces sodium and water retention, leading to edema and ascites. \u2022 Hypercholesterolemia is a consequence of decreased catabolism and increased hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins. \u2022 Complications include hypertension, hypercoagulability, muscle wasting, and weight loss. \u2022 Thromboembolism is a consequence of a generalized procoagulative state, due to increased platelet number and sensitivity, urinary loss of antithrombin, and increased concentrations of clotting factors. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014persistent proteinuria. With progressive disease and nephron loss, azotemia chronic kidney disease and uremia may occur. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014edema, ascites, hypercholesterolemia/hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, and thromboembolic disease. GENETICS Familial glomerular diseases have been reported (see Glomerulonephritis and Amyloidosis), but may be less likely to result in nephrotic syndrome than nonfamilial disease. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Nephrotic syndrome is an uncommon complication of glomerular disease, with a median of 0.5 new cases per year diagnosed at 8 veterinary teaching hospitals. \u2022 Nephrotic syndrome has not been associated with histologic subtype of glomerular disease. Amyloidosis and immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis have the highest magnitude of proteinuria and might be expected to have a higher prevalence of nephrotic syndrome. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections None Mean Age and Range Dogs with nephrotic syndrome are typically younger than those with non-nephrotic glomerular disease (mean, 6.2 years vs. 8.4 years). Predominant Sex None SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Pitting subcutaneous edema and/or ascites. \u2022 Clinical signs associated with an underlying infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disease may be the primary reason for seeking veterinary care. \u2022 Rarely, acute dyspnea, severe panting, weakness, or collapse due to pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary thromboembolism. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Dependent pitting, subcutaneous edema, or ascites. \u2022 Complications of hypertension: retinal hemorrhage or detachment, papilledema, arrhythmia and/or murmur secondary to left ventricular hypertrophy. \u2022 Dyspnea and/or cyanosis with pleural effusion or pulmonary thromboembolism. CAUSES \u2022 Glomerular disease may be a consequence of chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., infection, neoplasia, or immune-mediated diseases). \u2022 Nephrotic syndrome is unlikely to be solely a consequence of severe proteinuria; additional unidentified factors appear to be necessary. RISK FACTORS See Causes.", "Nephrotoxicity, Drug-Induced": " Renal injury caused by a pharmacologic agent used to diagnose or treat a medical disorder. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Drugs can cause nephrotoxicosis by interfering with renal blood flow, glomerular function, tubular function, or inducing interstitial inflammation. \u2022 Many drugs are nephrotoxic because they are excreted primarily by the kidneys. \u2022 Most nephrotoxic drugs cause proximal renal tubular necrosis. \u2022 If renal injury is severe, acute kidney injury develops. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, or melena due to gastrointestinal irritation or uremic ulceration. \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014metabolic acidosis due to decreased elimination of acid by kidneys and inability to reclaim bicarbonate filtered into tubules by glomeruli. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014anemia due to blood loss or decreased red blood cell survival in patients with uremia; increased susceptibility to infections because of immune dysfunction in patients with uremia. \u2022 Nervous\u2014depression, lethargy associated with effect of uremic toxins on the CNS. \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014weakness due to systemic effects of uremia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea or respiratory distress due to uremic pneumonitis or compensatory response for metabolic acidosis.

Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Dehydration. \u2022 Oral ulcers. \u2022 Uremic halitosis. CAUSES Antimicrobial Drugs \u2022 Aminoglycosides\u2014all drugs in this class are potentially nephrotoxic, including neomycin, gentamicin, amikacin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. Due to frequent use in the past, nephrotoxicosis associated with aminoglycoside treatment was most often associated with gentamicin. \u2022 Tetracyclines\u2014outdated products can cause acquired Fanconi\u00adlike syndrome characterized by glucosuria, proteinuria, and renal tubular acidosis; IV administration to dogs at high dosages ( > 30 mg/kg) can cause acute kidney injury. \u2022 Administration of sulfa drugs (e.g., trimethoprim\u2013sulfadiazine) has been associated with acute kidney injury in dogs, but no causal relationship has been proven. Antifungal Drugs Amphotericin B. Antineoplastic Drugs \u2022 Cisplatin\u2014clinically important cause of nephrotoxicosis in dogs. \u2022 Doxorubicin\u2014possible cause of nephrotoxicosis in cats but not well documented. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) \u2022 Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, carprofen, piroxicam, meloxicam, flunixin meglumine, and others may cause nephrotoxicosis. \u2022 Most likely to cause renal injury in patients with preexisting kidney disease or patients with concomitant dehydration or other causes of hypovolemia. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors \u2022 Enalapril, benazepril, and others. \u2022 Most likely to cause acute kidney injury in patients with hyponatremia, dehydration, or congestive heart failure. Radiographic Contrast Agents IV administration of ionic radiographic contrast agents can cause acute kidney injury, especially in patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, or hypotension associated with inhalational anesthesia. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Dehydration. \u2022 Advanced age, probably because older patients have preexisting kidney disease. \u2022 Kidney disease, inactive or active. \u2022 Renal hypoperfusion; potential causes include any disorder associated with hypovolemia (e.g., vomiting, hemorrhage, hypoadrenocorticism), low cardiac output (e.g., congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, cardiac arrhythmias, inhalational anesthesia), or renal vasoconstriction (e.g., NSAID administration). \u2022 Electrolyte and acid\u2013base abnormalities including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic acidosis. \u2022 Concurrent drug therapy\u2014administration of furosemide increases nephrotoxicosis of aminoglycosides; treatment with cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide) may increase nephrotoxic potential of drugs. \u2022 Fever. \u2022 Sepsis.", "Nerve Sheath Tumors": " \u2022 Tumors of the peripheral nerves, spinal nerves, or nerve roots. \u2022 Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is the recommended denomination for these tumors, instead of schwannoma, neurilemmoma, or neurofibroma, since determination of the cell of origin is often impossible. \u2022 Most tumors (80%) occur in the thoracic limb of dogs. \u2022 Approximately 50% of the tumors are located in the plexus or peripheral nerve region and 50% in the nerve root region. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs\u2014no breed or gender predisposition. \u2022 Mean age in dogs\u20147.9 years; uncommon in dogs younger than 3 years. \u2022 Rare in cats. SIGNS \u2022 Chronic progressive thoracic limb lameness. \u2022 Muscle atrophy (neurogenic atrophy) often present, more severe than that observed with orthopedic disorders. \u2022 Decreased muscle tone and decreased flexor reflex can be observed. \u2022 Axillary palpation detects a mass in less than 30% of cases. \u2022 Axillary pain upon palpation occasionally. \u2022 Horner\u2019s syndrome can be seen in tumors involving the T1\u2013T3 nerve roots. \u2022 Ataxia, paresis, and asymmetric proprioceptive deficits can be seen if the tumor compresses the spinal cord. \u2022 Cutaneous trunci reflex may be poor to absent on the affected side. \u2022 In lumbosacral tumors, rectal palpation can be useful for mass detection. \u2022 Self\u00admutilation is occasionally observed. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Mutation of the neu oncogene was identified in some cases.", "Neuroaxonal Dystrophy": " \u2022 Inherited degenerative diseases of neurons in diverse regions of the CNS, particularly the cerebellum and associated pathways. \u2022 Primary neuroaxonal dystrophy disorders are sometimes classified as abiotrophies. \u2022 Inheritance\u2014autosomal recessive in breeds where heritability is proven. \u2022 The main pathologic feature of neuroaxonal dystrophy, axonal spheroids, also occurs in normal aging, as well as secondary to a number of other diseases, such as acquired or inherited metabolic diseases, and toxicities. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Breeds predisposed\u2014domestic and Siamese cats, Rottweilers, collies, papillons, Chihuahuas, German shepherd dogs, Jack Russell terriers, and boxers. \u2022 Age at onset\u2014breed-specific, ranging from under 2 months of age in cats, Chihuahuas, and papillons, to 1\u20132 years in Rottweilers. SIGNS \u2022 Cerebellar ataxia\u2014progressive dysmetria and hypermetria of the limbs (rarely hypometria) with patellar hyperreflexia. \u2022 Strength and proprioception normal in most cases. Rottweilers may have extensive involvement of the dorsal columns of the cervical spinal cord and may exhibit proprioceptive deficits. \u2022 Loss of menace responses despite normal vision and facial nerves. \u2022 Progressive signs of brainstem involvement may be a feature, especially in papillons, including loss of swallowing reflex and abnormal tongue movement; tetraplegia may develop in the final stages. \u2022 Mild intention tremors or head and neck dysmetria in some patients. \u2022 Primarily cerebellar signs in Rottweilers, collies, Chihuahuas, and domestic cats; predominantly spinal cord lesions in German shepherd dogs and boxers; tremors and cerebellar ataxia present in all affected animals. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Unknown. \u2022 Usually classified as neuronal abiotrophy. \u2022 Autosomal recessive inheritance proven in some breeds. \u2022 Breed predisposition.", "Neutropenia": " \u2022 Neutrophil count below the reference interval. \u2022 Can occur alone or as a component of bi- or pancytopenia. \u2022 Often accompanied by a left shift and toxic change (e.g., cytoplasmic basophilia, D\u00f6hle bodies, foamy cytoplasmic vacuolation, and/ or toxic granulation). \u2022 Certain breeds (e.g., greyhound, Belgian Tervuren) can have a neutrophil count below the reference interval for other breeds. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Results from one of four mechanisms: (1) decreased production or release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, (2) a shift from the circulating pool within the large vessels to the marginating pool, (3) increased migration from blood into the tissues due to severe inflammation/tissue consumption, and (4) immune-mediated destruction. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Predisposes to infections, affecting many body systems in any combination, depending on the site(s) of infection. GENETICS \u2022 Cyclic hematopoiesis can result in intermittent neutropenia. \u2022 A genetic trait with delayed penetrance results in age-related neutropenia in Belgian Tervuren dogs. \u2022 Selective cobalamin malabsorption is an autosomal recessive trait in many breeds that results in neutropenia, including Imerslund\u2013 Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome in border collies. \u2022 An autosomal recessive neutropenia (trapped neutrophil syndrome) in border collies from Australia and New Zealand is characterized by a deficiency of circulating segmented neutrophils and myeloid cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Not specific for secondary infections. \u2022 Schnauzers, beagles, Australian shepherd dogs, shar-peis, Komondorok, and border collies can have heritable cobalamin malabsorption. \u2022 Grey collies and possibly border collies and Basset hounds may exhibit cyclic hematopoiesis. \u2022 Aged Belgian Tervurens. \u2022 Related border collies in Australia and New Zealand can have chronic neutropenia. \u2022 Rottweiler dogs overrepresented for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) deficiency. SIGNS \u2022 Septic animals usually have nonspecific signs. Fever is common, but normothermia does not exclude infection. Septic shock may be present. \u2022 Grey collies with cyclic hematopoiesis exhibit severe neutropenia every 12\u201314 days. Episodes of fever, diarrhea, gingivitis, respiratory infection, lymphadenitis, and arthritis occur in association with the neutropenia. \u2022 No clinical signs in Belgian Tervurens.

Infection arises from direct inoculation of the organisms into the skin. Nocardia spp are ubiquitous soil and water saprophytes: Infection is usually a consequence of inoculation via scratch, bite or foreign body penetrating wound. Actinomyces and Arcanobacteria are normal inhabitants of the oropharynx and infection frequently follows a bite wound. Infection typically remains restricted to the skin, but dissemination to internal organs (lungs) can occur in both diseases. SIGNALMENT Dogs and cats with access to the outdoors are predisposed. SIGNS Cutaneous lesions in both infections consist of nodules, subcutaneous swellings or abscesses that often develop draining sinuses. Diffuse cellulitis with numerous draining tracts may occur. In actinomycosis, draining tracts discharge a thick yellow-gray or hemorrhagic exudate that may contain sulfur granules. In nocardiosis the discharge is less abundant. Lesions are typically located on areas of wounds as limbs, feet, thorax, or abdomen. Regional lymphadenopathy is common. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Nocardia (most commonly N. cyriacigeorgica , N. nova , N. abscessus , N. farcinica , and N. otitisdiscaviarum ) are Gram-positive, partially acid-fast, branching filamentous aerobic bacteria with worldwide distribution. Actinomyces (most commonly A. bowdenii , A. canis , A. viscosus, A. odontolyticus, A. meyeri , and Arcanobacterium pyogenes ) are Grampositive, non-acid fast, filamentous anaerobic rods that are opportunistic commensals of the oral cavity and bowel. Most Actinomyces infections are complicated by mixed infections with other bacteria.", "Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Toxicosis": " \u2022 Toxicosis secondary to the acute or chronic ingestion of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). \u2022 NSAIDs\u2014classed as carboxylic acids (aspirin, indomethacin, sulindac, ibuprofen, naproxen, carprofen, meclofenamic acid, etodolac, flunixin meglumine) or enolic acids (phenylbutazone, dipyrone, meloxicam, tepoxalin, and piroxicam); selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (deracoxib, firocoxib, mavacoxib (Europe), and robenacoxib). \u2022 Newer selective COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs with preferential activity against COX-2 may have fewer adverse reactions than older COX-1 inhibitors, though both pathways may be inhibited following overdose. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Action\u2014analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase; decreases production of prostaglandins that act as mediators of inflammation. \u2022 Well absorbed orally. \u2022 Clearance\u2014varies greatly among species; eliminated slowly in dogs and cats; half-life varies significantly among NSAIDs. \u2022 Metabolized in the liver to active or inactive metabolites. \u2022 Excreted in the kidney via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, and/or biliary excretion.

This pathway is part of the vestibular system, and provides coordinated conjugate eye movements in association with changes in head position. \u2022 Physiologic nystagmus (ocular\u2013vestibular reflex)\u2014normal finding, induced by rotating the head from side to side; characterized by a jerk nystagmus with a slow drifting of the eye in the opposite direction of the head rotation followed by a fast compensatory phase in the same direction as the head movement. Decreased to absent physiologic nystagmus is indicative of vestibular disease. \u2022 Pathologic nystagmus\u2014a sign of vestibular dysfunction; characterized by a jerk nystagmus that develops independent of head movement. The nystagmus is described according to the axis of movement of the globe (horizontal, rotary, or vertical), and the direction of the fast phase of movement. \u2022 Spontaneous or resting nystagmus\u2014 pathologic nystagmus that occurs when the head is in a normal position and not moving; frequently resolves after several days. \u2022 Positional nystagmus\u2014pathologic nystagmus, elicited only when the head is placed in unusual position; can often be seen in more chronic conditions. \u2022 Jerk nystagmus must be differentiated from pendular nystagmus and from opsoclonus. \u2022 Pendular nystagmus\u2014congenital abnormality in which a larger-than-usual portion of the optic nerve fibers crosses in the chiasm; most often observed as an incidental finding in Siamese, Birman, and Himalayan cats but can also be seen with cerebellar disease and with visual deficits. \u2022 Opsoclonus\u2014involuntary, rapid, random eye movements in multiple directions that can be seen with cerebellar disease; can be differentiated from jerk nystagmus by the lack of a slow phase and its chaotic nature.

RISK FACTORS Systemic administration of certain antibiotics (metronidazole, aminoglycoside), otic administration of iodophors and chlorhexidine solutions.", "Obesity": " Obesity is the unhealthy accumulation of body fat. Precise definitions are debated but it is widely accepted that dogs or cats with body condition score (BCS) 6 or 7 on a 9-point scale are over - weight, and those with BCS 8 or 9 are obese. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Animals gain weight when energy intake from food chronically exceeds energy expended to maintain basic homeostatic processes and during exercise. \u2022 Homeostatic neuroendocrine responses ensure food intake meets energy requirements and establish modest energy reserves in case of a period of fasting. \u2022 Energy homeostasis may be disrupted by: ready availability of highly palatable energy-dense food (which elicits hedonic responses that override homeostatic satiation); genetic variation in appetite; neutering; and limits to a pet\u2019s ability to exercise. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Endocrine\u2014insulin resistance develops secondary to obesity and can lead to diabetes mellitus in cats. \u2022 Immune\u2014adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity causes a proinflammatory state. \u2022 Other organ systems may be affected by the mechanical effect of increased body fat and/ or endocrine and metabolic disruption. GENETICS \u2022 Breed variation in obesity predisposition suggests obesity susceptibility is in part heritable with a polygenic mode of inheritance. \u2022 Mutations in the genes POMC (Labrador and flatcoat retrievers) and MC4R (beagles) are associated with obesity and/or food motivation. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Common. As many as 65% of dogs and 25% cats are overweight or obese. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Widespread SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Domestic shorthair cats. \u2022 Labrador retriever, Cairn terrier, cavalier King Charles spaniel, Scottish terrier, cocker spaniel.

We focus here on the most common odontogenic tumors: \u2022 Conventional ameloblastoma (CA): \u25e6 Benign but expansile, locular to multilocular tumor of the jaws in dogs and cats. \u25e6 Differs in biological behavior from the more common CAA. \u2022 Canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma (CAA): \u25e6 Benign but invasive tumor of the jaws. \u25e6 Typically more invasive than expansile. \u25e6 No apparent human analogue. \u2022 Amyloid\u00adproducing odontogenic tumor (APOT): \u25e6 Benign but expansile tumor of the jaws affecting primarily dogs. \u25e6 Similar biological behavior to the CA with a propensity to produce amyloid. \u2022 Feline inductive odontogenic tumor (FIOT): \u25e6 Benign odontogenic tumor unique to cats. \u25e6 Generally expansile and locular with epicenter at an impacted and/or malformed maxillary canine tooth. \u2022 Peripheral odontogenic fibroma (POF): \u25e6 Benign tumor primarily composed of periodontal ligament\u00adlike stroma arising from tissue near the alveolar margin. \u25e6 Current debate as to whether this is a tumor or a reactive lesion. \u2022 Feline \u201cepulides\u201d: \u25e6 Clinically presents as a typical epulis. \u25e6 Not clear whether this lesion is analogous to POF of dogs. \u25e6 Most cats are presented with multifocal lesions distributed throughout the entire oral cavity. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog\u2014odontogenic tumors are generally considered uncommon but CAA has been reported to be the fourth most common oral tumor in dogs. POF may be even more common. \u2022 Cat\u2014odontogenic tumors are rare in cats. \u2022 CAA is more common in golden retrievers and possibly cocker spaniels. \u2022 Boxers may have higher incidence of POF.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is typically polyuric, where UOP >2 mL/kg/h is expected. \u2022 Anuria\u2014limited/no urine formation (UOP <0.08 mL/kg/h). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Physiologic (prerenal) oliguria\u2014kidneys limit water loss during state of reduced renal perfusion to preserve fluid and electrolyte balance. High plasma osmolality or low circulating fluid volume stimulate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesis and release, which induces formation of small quantity of concentrated urine. \u2022 Pathologic (renal) oliguria\u2014severe renal parenchymal impairment. Factors include: high resistance in afferent glomerular vessels, low glomerular permeability, back leak of filtrate from damaged renal tubules, renal intratubular obstruction, and extensive loss of nephrons resulting in marked reduction of glomerular filtrate produced. \u2022 Anuria\u2014may be renal or postrenal origin. Severe renal disease occasionally causes anuria. Mechanisms are the same as for pathologic oliguria (e.g., urinary tract obstruction (UTO) or excretory pathway rupture).

Raw opium powder contains 24 alkaloids including ~10% morphine, 0.5% codeine, and thebaine (codeine methyl enol ether). \u2022 Opioids have been used for millennia, but human use and abuse of opioids has drastically increased the last several years and has been increasing overall for the prior 20 years. This corresponds to an increase in accidental canine oral exposures. \u2022 In dogs, opioids generally act as CNS, respiratory, and cardiovascular depressants, however thebaine has stimulatory properties. \u2022 In cats, CNS stimulation often occurs following opioid toxicosis. \u2022 Range of opioids and opiates includes: \u25e6 Agonists\u2014morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, heroin, desomorphine, alfentanil, tramadol (also a serotonin reuptake inhibitor), loperamide (relatively low concentrations achieved in the CNS). \u25e6 Partial agonists or agonists/antagonists\u2014 butorphanol, buprenorphine. \u2022 Toxic dose is highly variable depending on specific opioid. Cats have an increased susceptibility to morphine due to the lack of glucuronyl transferase and therefore glucuronidation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Opioids are weakly acidic and well absorbed by oral and transmucosal route. \u2022 Significant hepatic metabolism and first pass effect. \u2022 Oral exposure to cut or chewed transdermal patches can result in increased and rapid absorption compared to that of the intended transdermal route. The amount of fentanyl remaining in used patches is highly variable and can be between 28 and 84%. \u2022 Opioid receptors are found in the CNS, autonomic nervous system (ANS), gastrointestinal (GI) tract, heart, kidney, adipocytes, lymphocytes, vas deferens, and adrenal gland. The receptor types present and the clinical significance in toxicosis varies widely between tissue type. \u2022 Major opioid receptors include: \u25e6 mu\u20142 specific types. Agonist stimulation of mu 1 results in supraspinal analgesia while mu 2 results in spinal analgesia, respiratory suppression and decreased GI motility. \u25e6 delta\u2014equivocal role; possibly potentiates mu receptor agonists or has increased selectivity for enkephalins compared to mu receptors. Results in spinal analgesia and possibly decreased GI motility, decreased cardiovascular function, and altered behavior. \u25e6 kappa\u2014agonist stimulation results in analgesia, sedation, and dysphoria. \u25e6 sigma\u2014does not mediate analgesia significantly; no longer classified as an opioid receptor. \u2022 Minor receptors include: epsilon and zeta.

In 2017, organophosphate and carbamate exposures represented only 2.2% of insecticide-related exposure calls.. \u2022 The decrease is likely related to EPA cancellations of various registrations and approval of new, less hazardous compounds and delivery formulations. Canceled products, however, often remain in homes and businesses for years. In 2017 the most commonly reported exposures from most to least were to products containing propoxur, acephate, carbaryl, and tetrachlorvinphos. \u2022 Animal products\u2014organophosphate: chlorpyrifos, coumaphos, cythioate, diazinon, famphur, fenthion, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos; carbamate: carbaryl and propoxur.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Cause nervous system effects by inhibiting cholinesterase, which includes acetylcholinesterase, pseudocholinesterase, other esterases. \u2022 Acetylcholinesterase\u2014normally hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in nervous tissue, red blood cells, and muscle, resulting in termination of nervous transmission. \u2022 Pseudocholinesterase\u2014found in plasma, liver, pancreas, nervous tissue; mainly in cats. \u2022 Cholinesterase inhibition\u2014allows acetylcholine accumulation at the postsynaptic receptor; causes stimulation of effector organs; spontaneous reactivation after organophosphorus compound binding is very slow and once aging occurs is virtually nonexistent; reversible after carbamate binding. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nervous\u2014results from overriding stimulation of parasympathetic pathways; may also result from sympathetic stimulation; acetylcholine stimulates nicotinic receptors of the somatic nervous system (skeletal muscle), parasympathetic preganglionic nicotinic and postganglionic muscarinic receptors (cardiac muscle, pupil, blood vessels, smooth muscles in lung and gastrointestinal tract, exocrine glands), and sympathetic preganglionic nicotinic receptors (adrenal and indirectly cardiac muscle, pupil, blood vessels, smooth muscles in lung and gastrointestinal tract, exocrine glands). GENETICS \u2022 Animals with inherently low cholinesterase activity\u2014more susceptible to cholinesterase depression. \u2022 Cholinesterase activity\u2014more easily inhibited in cats than in dogs. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Uncommon in small animals. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Historically more common in areas of high flea prevalence and intense agricultural activity. SIGNALMENT Species \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Cats most susceptible. Breed Predilections Lean dogs (e.g., sight hounds and racing breeds) and lean longhaired cats\u2014more susceptible to cholinesterase inhibition because of lack of fat; many organophosphorus compounds and metabolites are stored in fat and slowly released into circulation.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Cells of the immature articular joint cartilage and growth plates do not differentiate normally. \u2022 For articular cartilage, the process of endochondral ossification is retarded, presumably due to localized, focal disruption of blood supply. If blood supply is reestablished, healing occurs. Alternatively, if blood supply is not reestablished, cartilage remains thick and there is separation between the cartilage and subchondral bone. Eventually a fissure occurs through the articular cartilage that allows communication with the joint cavity. The result is creation of a cartilage flap that is separated from the underlying subchondral bone; this condition is known as osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). \u2022 Bilateral disease common. \u2022 Most commonly affected joints\u2014shoulder (caudocentral humeral head); elbow (medial aspect of the humeral condyle); stifle (femoral condyle, lateral more often than medial); hock (ridge of the talus, medial more common than lateral). \u2022 Other reported locations\u2014femoral head; dorsal rim of the acetabulum; glenoid cavity (scapula); patella; distal radius; medial malleolus; cranial end plate of the sacrum; vertebral articular facets; cervical vertebrae. Immature Joint Cartilage \u2022 Thickened cartilage results in impaired metabolism, leading to degeneration and necrosis of the poorly supplied cells. \u2022 Fissure within the thickened cartilage\u2014may result from mechanical stress; eventually leads to the formation of a cartilage flap or OCD; may cause lameness. \u2022 Lameness (pain)\u2014usually becomes evident once OCD develops; osteochondrosis is often asymptomatic. Retention of Cartilage in Growth Plates \u2022 Usually does not lead to necrosis, probably owing to nutrition provided by vessels within the cartilage. \u2022 Failure of endochondral ossification can lead to decreased longitudinal bone growth. When this is severe and occurs in the distal ulnar physis, angular limb deformity may result.

Large- to giant-breed dogs most commonly develop appendicular OS, while axial OS tends to affect smaller breeds (<15 kg). The biologic behavior of OS is aggressive locally and distantly, with presumed microscopic lung metastases present in \u226585% of dogs at diagnosis. OS is rare in cats, and the biologic behavior is less malignant than in dogs. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Genetic predisposition is likely a major contributor for the development of OS. Other factors contributing include chronic inflammation associated with metallic implants, history of prior radiation therapy to the site of tumorigenesis, and rapid bone turnover, all associated with the development of OS in dogs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014the appendicular skeleton (metaphyseal region of long bones) is most commonly affected in dogs.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 With physiologic pain, an application of a noxious stimulus activates specialized nerve endings called nociceptors; nociceptors transduce noxious chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli into electrochemical potentials that are transmitted via sensory nerves from the affected tissue to the spinal cord. \u2022 In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the incoming first\u00adorder peripheral nerve synapses with ascending spinal neurons, which terminate in the brainstem. Incoming noxious information can be modulated in the dorsal horn by other incoming information, descending inhibitory nerve impulses, or pharmacologic inhibition by several classes of drugs. The ascending neurons synapse in the brainstem to form ascending tracts that end in the cortex, where sensation occurs. Neuroendocrine and physiologic responses (e.g., tachycardia, elevated cortisol) to noxious stimuli may originate from the brainstem and do not necessarily correlate with the perceived intensity of pain. \u2022 Nociceptive processes (i.e., transduction, transmission, and modulation) appear to be similar anatomically and physiologically in most mammalian and many non\u00admammalian species. The perception of pain may vary between species and individuals of the same species since anatomic differences in cortical development exist and integration of past experiences and learned behaviors varies. \u2022 Prolonged activity in nociceptive pathways (e.g., days, weeks, or months) from chronic injury or disease, or injury to nervous system tissues, may cause altered neuroprocessing resulting in sensitization of these pathways and hyperresponsiveness. This may cause an increased response to a stimulus not normally considered noxious (allodynia). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Pain may originate from any tissue, including the nervous system itself. In humans, certain pain syndromes may be associated with fear, anxiety, or depression in the absence of any observable injury. \u2022 The physiologic response to pain can include decreased immune function, increased catabolism, and elevated neuro\u00ad endocrine markers of stress. Pain can result in a loss of function of affected tissues. GENETICS Age, sex, breeding strain, and species can influence responses to noxious stimuli. Genes have been described that modify individual behavioral responses to noxious stimuli in several species. Genes may also be variably expressed depending on stimulus intensity and duration, which can lead to altered neuroprocessing and maladaptive or chronic pain. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Evolutionarily, aversion to noxious stimuli was protective to organisms, keeping them away from harm. \u2022 While acute pain is beneficial to warn or teach an animal about potential harmful objects in its environment, persistent acute pain associated with surgery or injury does not benefit the patient and should be treated appropriately. \u2022 Any form of chronic pain syndrome does not serve a protective function and should be treated. SIGNS \u2022 Behavioral signs of pain and distress vary considerably among individuals. \u2022 Experience, environment, age, species, and other factors can modify the intensity of the reaction to noxious stimuli or to an altered neurobiology associated with maladaptive or chronic pain. \u2022 The most obvious clinical signs of distress in the dog and cat can include vocalization, agitation, abnormal posture or gait, thrashing, hyperesthesia, or hyperalgesia. \u2022 More subtle signs shared by many conditions include trembling, lethargy, reduced appetite, stupor, and biting. \u2022 Tachypnea, tachycardia, mydriasis, and hypertension are signs observed with the stress response that may also accompany pain; these are nonspecific and present in many nonpainful conditions. The stress response is often not associated with chronic pain due to adaptation. \u2022 Clinical signs associated with chronically painful conditions may be very subtle or difficult to evaluate since homeostatic mechanisms tend to help the animal compensate. Chronically painful conditions are often associated with decreased activity, lameness, and/or depression. CAUSES \u2022 Physiologic or adaptive pain can be caused by perceived or actual tissue disruption associated with trauma or surgery and also by chronic degenerative changes and inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis. \u2022 Pain that extends beyond the initial tissue damage and healing processes is pathologic (maladaptive) and may indicate that the initiation of altered nervous system processing has occurred. RISK FACTORS \u2022 All animals that experience surgical or traumatic tissue damage or have recently altered behavior should be evaluated for the presence of pain. \u2022 Due to the increasing prevalence of degenerative diseases in older patients, routine examination should include evaluation for pain. \u2022 Pain intensity may not always correlate with the degree of tissue damage. However, more invasive soft tissue and orthopedic procedures or inflammatory disease progression in older patients are likely associated with greater pain.", "Palatal Defects": " Communication between the nasal and oral cavities.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Host defense mechanisms normally prevent pancreatic autodigestion by pancreatic enzymes, but under select circumstances these natural defenses fail; autodigestion occurs when these digestive enzymes are activated within acinar cells. \u2022 Local and systemic tissue injury is due to the activity of released pancreatic enzymes and a variety of inflammatory mediators such as kinins, free radicals, and complement factors that are released by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The most common pathologies involving the feline pancreas include acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), acute suppurative pancreatitis, and chronic nonsuppurative pancreatitis.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Mechanisms may include decreased production of cells in the bone marrow or increased peripheral use, destruction, or sequestration; one or more of these mechanisms may occur together. \u2022 Decreased production occurs when pluripotent, multipotent, or committed stem cells are destroyed, their proliferation or differentiation is suppressed, or the maturation of differentiated cells is delayed or arrested. \u2022 If pluripotent stem cells are affected, pancytopenia develops; if committed stem cells are involved, cytopenia of the specific cell type develops. \u2022 Increased use and destruction of cells typically results in increased production in the bone marrow. At least 2\u20133 days are required before increased production begins to have an effect on peripheral blood cell counts, and peak output usually takes about a week; thus, the rate of use or destruction necessary to cause cytopenia is not as great during the first few days of disease as it is later. \u2022 Sequestration of cells in the microcirculation, especially that of the spleen, intestine, and lungs, can cause cytopenia of the cell type involved.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Respiratory rate, rhythm, and effort are controlled by the respiratory center in the brainstem in response to numerous afferent pathways, both central and peripheral in origin. These include the cerebral cortex, central chemoreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors, stimulation of mechano receptors in the airways that sense lung inflation and deflation, stimulation of irritant receptors of the airways, stimulation of C-fibers in the alveoli and pulmonary blood vessels that sense interstitial congestion, and baroreceptors that sense changes in blood pressure. \u2022 Tachypnea and panting can occur in response to stimulation of any of the above receptor pathways. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Respiratory SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat; no age, or sex predilection. \u2022 Older, large-breed dogs predisposed to panting associated with laryngeal paralysis. \u2022 Brachycephalic dogs prone to panting due to upper airway obstruction.

Patient presents paraplegic, in lateral recumbency with extension of front limbs and neck. However front limb function is normal on neurologic examination. Prognosis based on presence or absence of pain perception in pelvic limbs. \u2022 Spinal shock\u2014may occur with severe spinal cord trauma, usually near the thoracolumbar spine. Initially the paralyzed pelvic limbs are areflexic but become hyperreflexic (and more indicative of a T3\u2013L3 lesion localization) within minutes to a few hours after the trauma. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Weakness\u2014caused by lesions in the upper motor neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) systems. \u2022 UMN system\u2014cell bodies or nuclei located within the brain are responsible for initiating voluntary movement; axons from these cell bodies form tracts (rubrospinal, corticospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal) that descend from the brain to synapse on the interneurons in the spinal cord. Interneuronal axons synapse on large alpha motor neurons in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord; these are cell bodies of origin for the LMN system, which is responsible for spinal reflexes. \u2022 LMN system\u2014collections of lower motor neurons in the cervical and lumbar intumescences give rise to axons that form the ventral nerve roots, spinal nerves, and (ultimately) the peripheral nerves that innervate limb muscles. \u2022 Evaluation of limb reflexes\u2014determines which system (UMN or LMN) is involved. \u2022 UMN and their axons\u2014 have inhibitory influence on the large alpha motor neurons of the LMN system; maintain normal muscle tone and normal spinal reflexes. \u2022 If UMN is injured, spinal reflexes are no longer inhibited or controlled and spinal reflexes become exaggerated or hyperreflexic. \u2022 If LMN system is injured, spinal reflexes cannot be elicited (areflexic) or are reduced (hyporeflexic). Large alpha motor neurons or their processes (peripheral nerves) also maintain normal muscle tone. With LMN injury, muscle wasting is usually severe and within 5\u20137 days of injury.

These disorders are usually caused by production and release of substances not normally released by the cancerous cell of origin or in amounts not normally produced by those cells. Other etiologies of PNS aside from production of metabolically active substances include autoimmune disease stimulation, immune complex formation, immunosuppression, and ectopic receptor production/competitive blockade of normal signaling molecules. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The pathophysiology depends on the specific PNS (see Table 1). Many PNS in veterinary medicine have an unknown pathophysiologic etiology. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Any body system can be affected by a PNS. Some of the more common systems include: \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014hypercalcemia. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014anemia, thrombocytopenia. GENETICS One known genetic cause of a PNS is the mutation H255R of the encoding folliculin gene ( FLCN ) leading to renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular dermatofibrosis, predominantly seen in German shepherd dogs but rarely noted in non-shepherds. SIGNALMENT Any dog or cat with a histologically malignant (most common) or benign cancer (rare).

In large-breed dogs, Great Pyrenees and Labrador retrievers are most commonly affected. Mean Age and Range Clinical signs\u2014may develop soon after birth with severe luxation or secondary bone deformities; generally after 4 months of age. Mild clinical signs that are not interpreted by clients as lameness are often undetected until secondary osteoarthritis advances. Predominant Sex Risk for females 1.5 times that for males. SIGNS General Comments Clinical expression depends on grade (severity), amount of degenerative arthritis, chronicity of disease, and occurrence of other stifle joint abnormalities (e.g., cruciate ligament rupture). Historical Findings \u2022 Persistent abnormal hind limb carriage and function in neonates and puppies. Clients may complain of \u201cbowed legs\u201d (genu varum) or crouched gait in small-breed dogs. \u2022 Occasional skipping or intermittent hind limb lameness\u2014worsens in young to mature dogs. \u2022 Sudden signs of lameness\u2014owing to minor trauma or worsening degenerative joint disease in mature animals. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Grade I\u2014patella can be manually displaced from the trochlea, but immediately resumes a normal position when pressure is released. Usually an incidental finding on physical examination and is not normally associated with clinical lameness. \u2022 Grade II\u2014patella can be manually displaced or can spontaneously do so with flexion of the stifle joint; patella remains malpositioned until it is manually reduced or the patient extends the stifle joint. Patient intermittently carries the affected limb with the stifle joint flexed, but ambulates normally at other times. \u2022 Grade III\u2014patella remains luxated most of the time but can be manually reduced with the stifle joint in extension; movement of the stifle joint results in reluxation of the patella. \u2022 Grade IV\u2014 patella is permanently luxated and cannot be manually repositioned; may be up to 90\u00b0 of rotation of the proximal tibial plateau; shallow or missing femoral trochlea. \u2022 Grades III and IV\u2014crouching, bowlegged (genu varum) or knock-kneed (genu valgum) stance for medial or lateral luxations, respectively; more of the body weight is transferred to the front limbs. \u2022 Pain\u2014occurs as the patella relocates or if abrasion creates contact with exposed bone.

RISK FACTORS Coxa vara\u2014lateral displacement of the proximal femur; vastus medialis and rectus femoris muscles pull the patella medially.", "Patent Ductus Arteriosus": " Persistent patency of this normal fetal structure. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Due to insufficient vascular smooth muscle the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, maintaining a persistent communication between the low-pressure pulmonary artery (PA) and high-pressure aorta (see Web Figures 1 and 2). Blood typically shunts left to right, with hemodynamic consequences depending on the magnitude of the shunt, pulmonary vascular resistance, and concurrent heart defects. Moderate-to-large shunts cause left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) from volume overload of the left ventricle (LV). Less often a largediameter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) induces severe pulmonary vascular injury, high pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary hypertension (PH), causing shunt reversal from Eisenmenger\u2019s pathophysiology. This is termed a \u201creversed\u201d PDA (rPDA), and leads to bidirectional shunting, arterial desaturation, and secondary erythrocytosis.

PE can be defined as an abnormally high volume of fluid within the pericardial sac; cardiac tamponade refers to the clinical syndrome that results from reduced cardiac output due to mechanical compression of the heart. Constrictive pericardial disease results when a markedly thickened and fibrotic pericardium limits the diastolic filling of the heart. Examples of space-occupying pericardial disease can include large masses in the pericardial space and peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 All pericardial diseases cause diastolic dysfunction, resulting in elevation and equalization of ventricular and venous pressures and reduced cardiac output. \u2022 Accumulation of effusion exceeds the elastic capabilities of the pericardial sac, resulting in elevated intrapericardial pressure. Cardiac tamponade occurs when intrapericardial pressure exceeds cardiac diastolic filling pressures. The compliant right atrium and right ventricle normally have the lowest filling pressures and are thus predominantly affected. Cardiac tamponade is present when intrapericardial pressures exceed the central venous pressure. The resultant reduction in cardiac venous return diminishes cardiac output. Animals with acute effusions typically exhibit signs of weakness or collapse. If intrapericardial pressure exceeds central venous pressure continuously for more than a few minutes, death occurs. \u2022 Constrictive pericardial disease directly restricts diastolic filling, causes dissociation of intracardiac and intrathoracic pressures and increases interventricular interdependence. \u2022 In animals with chronic pericardial disease, low cardiac output activates compensatory mechanisms that lead to fluid accumulation, typically manifested as right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014signs of low cardiac output and CHF. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014chronic passive congestion with mildly to moderately high liver enzymes. \u2022 Renal/urologic\u2014prerenal azotemia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea or pleural effusion. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014vomiting seen in some cases.

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide distribution; increased incidence of coccidioidomycosis-induced effusive constrictive pericarditis in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. SIGNALMENT Species Dog; PE in cat is often secondary to CHF. Breed Predilections \u2022 Golden retrievers and German shepherd dogs are predisposed to both right atrial hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and idiopathic effusion. \u2022 Brachycephalic breeds are predisposed to aortic body tumors (chemodectoma common in Boston terrier, boxer and bulldogs). \u2022 Idiopathic hemorrhagic pericarditis is more common in young to middle-aged, large-breed dogs (e.g., Great Pyrenees, Great Dane, Saint Bernard, golden retriever). Mean Age and Range Middle-aged to older dogs. Predominant Sex Male dogs may be predisposed to idiopathic effusion.

Rectal sacculation and dilation often occur. This results in abnormal function during defecation and, if left untreated, leads to herniation of pelvic and abdominal viscera. \u2022 Weakening of the pelvic diaphragm in male dogs is postulated to result from hormonal influences and by increased pressure secondary to enlargement of the prostate. \u2022 Separation of the perineal muscles (levator ani and coccygeus) from the external anal sphincter (EAS) and rectum allows lateral and ventral bulging and sacculation of the rectum when caudal abdominal pressure increases during defecation. Feces become entrapped within the sacculated rectum, contributing to the uncoordinated defecation often presented in patients with PH. Separation and weakening of the muscles also allows pelvic and abdominal viscera to migrate caudally, enter the hernia sac, and eventually become incarcerated or strangulated. SIGNALMENT Intact male dogs are at highest risk. The disease occurs rarely in castrated male dogs, female dogs, and cats. SIGNS \u2022 Constipation is the main feature, although some patients present with diarrhea as looser stool escapes around the firmer stool. \u2022 Unilateral or bilateral perineal bulge due to fecal impaction and/or herniation: \u25e6 May be dynamic or static. \u25e6 May become more obvious during events of increased intra-abdominal pressure\u2014 barking, coughing, defecation, and urination. \u25e6 Often the only presenting sign in cats. \u2022 Straining to urinate if bladder incarceration occurs. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Intact status in older male dogs and male dogs with unilateral or bilateral cryptor- chidism. \u2022 Underlying pathology leading to excessive straining: \u25e6 Prostatomegaly in male dogs. \u25e6 Megacolon and malunion of pelvic fractures in cats. \u2022 Caudal neuropathy, malformation or injury such as tail traction or avulsion. \u2022 Trauma (rare).", "Periodontal Disease": " Inflammation and destruction of the periodontium (i.e., gingiva, cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone) secondary to the subgingival biofilm of bacteria. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY A pellicle of salivary glycoproteins adheres to the clean tooth and first colonizing Grampositive aerobic bacteria attach; the plaque biofilm is created. The supragingival plaque biofilm matures and influences the development of the subgingival biofilm. The constituents of the biofilm progress to Gram-negative anaerobic, motile, and spirochete bacteria. Bacterial byproducts and proteolytic enzymes with the host inflammatory response cause destruction of the periodontium, resulting in the loss of attachment for the tooth. The biofilm forms within days. Calculus is the mineralization of plaque. It is rough, acts a surface area for more plaque development, and can be mechanically irritating to the tissues.

One or both kidneys are affected. \u2022 The tissue sac in which the fluid accumulates is not lined with secretory epithelium; and thus the name \u201cpseudo\u201d-cyst is appropriate. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Primarily older male cats (>8 years). \u2022 When detected in young cats, the disease is usually unilateral. \u2022 Rare in dogs; the difference in prevalence between species may be related to the prominent network of subcapsular veins that characterize feline kidneys.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Cause of perirenal accumulation of fluid is often not understood. \u2022 Accumulation of pseudocyst fluid is a dynamic, not a static, process. \u2022 Cytologic and biochemical evaluation of pseudocyst fluid may aid understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. \u2022 Fluid with characteristics of a transudate may accumulate because of high capillary hydrostatic pressure or lymphatic obstruction. Some cats have light microscopic evidence of renal fibrosis. However, it is not known whether progressive renal parenchymal contraction occludes lymphatics and blood vessels, promoting transudation of fluid. \u2022 Perirenal accumulation of transudate can also result from rupture of renal cysts. \u2022 Accumulation of perirenal urine may indicate disruption of the renal pelvis or the proximal ureter. \u2022 Accumulation of blood in pseudocysts can result from external trauma, surgery, neoplastic erosion of blood vessels, rupture of aneurysms, coagulopathies, or paracentesis of the urinary tract.", "Peritoneopericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia": " \u2022 Embryologic malformation of the ventral midline allowing communication between the pericardial and peritoneal cavities. \u2022 May be associated with other congenital malformations including sternal deformities (especially in cats), cranial abdominal hernia, and ventricular septal defects. \u2022 Signs may be due to large amounts of abdominal viscera compressing the heart or lungs and incarceration of abdominal organs (e.g., liver and small bowel).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Insult to the peritoneal cavity (localized or generalized) leads to inflammation characterized by vasodilation, cellular infiltration, pain, and development of adhesions. Fluid production is eventually favored over absorption, and progresses from transudate to exudate. \u2022 Extent and severity depend on type and severity of insult. \u2022 Response to bacterial peritonitis associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Gram-negative bacteria) or peptidoglycans (Gram-positive bacteria), causing inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production. NO causes vasodilation, can lead to hypotension. \u2022 Inflammation causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Cytokine release from leukocytes results in chemotaxis and activation of complement. Activation of complement results in coagulation, fibrin production and decreased fibrinolysis, resulting in adhesion formation. \u2022 Result of significant abdominal inflammation can be systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis.

Spontaneous development often occurs at sites of increased capillary trauma. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Thrombocytopenia results in impaired primary hemostasis and decreased production of platelet-derived trophic factors that maintain endothelial cell junction integrity. \u2022 Platelet numbers below 50 \u00d7 10 3 / \u03bc L and more often below 25 \u00d7 10 3 / \u03bc L are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous hemorrhage. \u2022 Thrombocytopathies are not generally associated with the development of petechiae.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. \u2022 Geography/travel history (susceptibility to tick-borne disease). \u2022 Certain drug exposures (e.g., sulfa-containing antimicrobials).", "Petroleum Hydrocarbon Toxicosis": " \u2022 Petroleum hydrocarbons are a diverse group of products derived or synthesized from crude oil. \u2022 Certain nonpetroleum-origin hydrocarbons, such as turpentine and linseed oil, are toxicologically similar enough to be considered with petroleum-origin products of similar molecular weight. Halogenated hydrocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride or methylene chloride, are sufficiently unique to warrant separate consideration. \u2022 Small animal poisoning most commonly results from exposure to refined commercial products including such disparate mixtures as fuels, solvents, lubricants, and waxes. \u2022 Petroleum-based solvents are often used as \u201cinert\u201d carriers for other potential toxicants (e.g., pesticides, paints, medications). \u2022 Most petroleum hydrocarbons can be \u201clumped\u201d into a relatively few broad categories based on volatility, viscosity, and surface tension. Mixtures with high boiling points (low volatility), such as asphalt, mineral oil, and waxes, are relatively nontoxic. Products with relatively low boiling points and low viscosities, such as benzene or turpentine, are more readily aspirated, penetrate further into airways, and are more likely to cause chemical pneumonitis. In general, products that are more volatile also tend to be more lipophilic and more readily absorbed systemically. Products with high aromatic content are also predisposed to cause systemic toxicity. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In general, the most acutely life-threatening effects of hydrocarbon ingestion result from aspiration-induced pneumonitis. \u2022 Viscosity and surface tension are reliable determinants of pneumotoxic potential. Low viscosity permits hydrocarbons to penetrate further into smaller airways. Low surface tension increases their tendency to \u201cwet\u201d pulmonary surfaces. For example, aspiration of as little as 0.1 mL of a low-viscosity hydrocarbon (e.g., hexane) may produce severe pneumonitis, whereas a high-viscosity product (e.g., motor oil) would not penetrate past the major airways. \u2022 Inhalation of hydrocarbon vapors (as opposed to aspirating liquid) may compromise pulmonary immune function and displace oxygen. \u2022 Topical exposure to hydrocarbon-based solvents (e.g., petroleum distillates, turpentine) may result in irritation and necrosis of skin and cornea. \u2022 Systemic toxicity is possible after oral or topical exposure. Although there are no quantitative data readily applicable to small animals, systemic toxicity should be considered when evaluating pets that have received a heavy topical exposure if the hydrocarbon is aromatic (e.g., benzene) or a low molecular weight (e.g., hexane). Topical exposure is especially important in very small animals (e.g., puppies, kittens, rodents), which have a relatively high body surface area to mass ratio. Systemic uptake and thus toxicity are also enhanced by factors such as a long hair coat, which traps the product against the skin. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiac. \u2022 Gastrointestinal. \u2022 Nervous. \u2022 Respiratory. \u2022 Skin. \u2022 Hematopoietic. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE In the author\u2019s experience, the incidence of small animal poisonings has decreased in recent years. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Pneumonitis is the most serious complication associated with ingestion of more volatile (e.g., gasoline) hydrocarbons. Respiratory signs usually occur within a few minutes to 1\u20132 hours post ingestion. The central nervous and gastrointestinal systems may also be affected; death usually results from respiratory failure. \u2022 If aspiration occurs simultaneously with ingestion, choking, coughing, gagging, and varying degrees of dyspnea will occur. Direct damage of airway components and bronchospasm may result in hypoxia. Cyanosis may develop immediately as alveolar oxygen is displaced by hydrocarbon vapor. \u2022 There is some evidence that some hydrocarbons sensitize the myocardium to both endogenous and exogenous catecholamines, precipitating arrhythmias; hemolytic anemia has been occasionally reported in children. Historical Findings \u2022 A history of (possible) exposure is essential to the diagnosis of hydrocarbon intoxication. Signs of hydrocarbon poisoning are seldom sufficiently characteristic to permit diagnosis. \u2022 Respiratory involvement, when present, is usually progressive over the first 24\u201348 hours, then gradually resolves 3\u201310 days following exposure. Animals that remain completely asymptomatic for 6\u201312 hours after ingestion are unlikely to develop respiratory illness. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Characteristic hydrocarbon odor on the animal\u2019s breath or coat. \u2022 Animals appear to experience a burning sensation in the mouth and pharynx after ingesting hydrocarbons, evidenced by slobbering, champing the jaws, shaking the head, and pawing at the muzzle. \u2022 Fever in 3\u20134 hours following aspiration; may occur in less than an hour or as much as 24 hours. \u2022 Vomiting, colic, and diarrhea after oral exposure. The severity and presence of such signs are a function of the dose and the individual hydrocarbon. Heavy aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., mineral oil) may produce mild diarrhea but little else. Lighter hydrocarbons (e.g., gasoline) are more likely to produce colic and vomiting. \u2022 Intoxicated animals may exhibit vertigo, ataxia, and mental confusion. Hydrocarbons produce depression and narcosis in most cases, but tremors and convulsions have also been reported in a few cases. If the dose is very high, the animal may become comatose and die prior to exhibiting signs of pneumonitis, although this is very rare. \u2022 Arrhythmias and syncope may occur as a result of myocardial sensitization to endogenous catecholamines. Myocardial sensitization may persist for 24\u201348 hours after apparent recovery from the neurologic effects of intoxication. CAUSES \u2022 Storage in inappropriate containers and failure to clean up spills. \u2022 Folk remedies using gasoline, kerosene, and other solvents as tonics or vermifuges. \u2022 Use of gasoline or other solvents to remove sticky material from an animal\u2019s coat. Cats may ingest significant amounts of gasoline or other hydrocarbons by grooming themselves after topical contamination.", "Pheochromocytoma": " A tumor arising from catecholamineproducing chromaffin cells that originate from neural crest cells within the adrenal medulla. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Clinical signs develop as a result of the space- occupying nature of the tumor and its metastases or from excessive secretion of catecholamines (e.g., causing hypertension or tachycardia).

RISK FACTORS None currently known.", "Polyarthritis, Nonerosive, Immune-Mediated, Dogs": " \u2022 Nonerosive polyarthritis\u2014a non-infectious inflammatory disease of multiple (>2) joints without radiographic evidence of bone or cartilage involvement. \u2022 Most common polyarthropathy in dogs, idiopathic or type I immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA). \u2022 Reactive polyarthropathy, where inflammation in the joints is secondary to distant disease, includes types II, III, and IV\u2014disease is secondary to chronic inflammatory or infectious disease, chronic gastrointestinal disease, and neoplasia, respectively. \u2022 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), familial shar-pei fever (FSF), and familial juvenile-onset polyarthritis of Akitas are less common nonerosive polyarthritides. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 All causes of nonerosive polyarthritis are immune-mediated. \u2022 Immune complex deposition is the underlying mechanism in idiopathic IMPA (type I) and reactive polyarthropathy (types II, III, and IV). \u2022 Reactive polyarthropathy involves immune stimulus distant to the joints due to underlying infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disease, as well as adverse drug reactions, with subsequent immune complex deposition in the synovium. \u2022 SLE is the result of immune complex deposition secondary to autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies [ANA]) formed against tissue proteins and DNA. \u2022 FSF is the result of amyloid deposition in the synovium. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Musculoskeletal: \u25e6 Appendicular joints are more commonly affected than axial joints. Intervertebral joints are not usually affected. \u25e6 Distal joints (carpus, tarsus) are more commonly affected than proximal joints (stifle, shoulder, coxofemoral) in IMPA. \u25e6 The hock joints are typically affected in FSF. \u2022 Hemic/ lymphatic/immune: \u25e6 Immune stimulus may result in fever, lethargy, and poor appetite. \u25e6 Hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may be present in SLE. \u2022 Skin/exocrine: \u25e6 Immune-mediated skin disease targeting the mucocutaneous junctions is common in SLE. \u2022 Renal/urologic: \u25e6 Immune-complex deposition in the kidneys and protein-losing nephropathy may be present in SLE. \u25e6 Glomerulonephropathy and proteinuria secondary to amyloidosis may occur in FSF. GENETICS MTBP gene missense mutation is believed to be responsible for FSF. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Idiopathic IMPA is common in dogs. \u2022 Reactive polyarthritis accounts for only 25% of nonerosive polyarthritis cases in dogs. \u2022 IMPA is rare in cats. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Large-breed dogs, such as Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, Rottweilers, Irish setters, Shetland sheepdogs, cocker spaniels, and American Eskimo dogs are overrepresented for idiopathic IMPA. \u2022 Doberman pinschers are overreported in cases of polyarthropathy secondary to sulfonamide administration.

CAUSES \u2022 Type I IMPA\u2014idiopathic. \u2022 Immunemediated dermatopathy and hepatopathy are among the most common noninfectious causes of type II IMPA. Infectious sources to consider include endocarditis, discospondylitis, prostatitis, deep pyoderma, and systemic infections (fungal, protozoal). \u2022 Type III IMPA occurs secondary to chronic gastrointestinal disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, but is rare. \u2022 Type IV IMPA has been reported secondary to renal carcinoma, mammary carcinoma, leiomyoma, Sertoli cell tumor, and seminoma. \u2022 Drugs implicated in adverse drug reaction-related polyarthropathy (type II) include human albumin, erythropoeitin, phenobarbital, and antibiotics such as sulfonamides, cephalosporins, penicillins, lincosamides, and macrolides. This should be considered a potential cause when administered 5\u201320 days prior to the onset of signs. \u2022 Reports of postvaccinal polyarthropathy have included canine distemper and Lyme vaccines, typically within 30 days of vaccine administration.

Also called proliferative cystitis. Polypoid projections are diffusely located over the luminal surface of the bladder. It is unclear if proliferative urethritis is a separate disease with different causes. If polyps erode and ulcerate, varying degrees of hematuria and dysuria occur. The gross appearance of polyps cannot be distinguished from that of bladder neoplasms, such as transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), without histological evaluation. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs with chronic urinary tract infection (UTI)s or urolithiasis. \u2022 No cases reported in cats. SIGNS \u2022 Initially, may be asymptomatic. \u2022 Hematuria is the most common sign. \u2022 Gross hematuria often occurs at the end of the micturition stream during maximal bladder contraction. \u2022 Pollakiuria and dysuria may also be present and are associated with irritation of the polyps. \u2022 Urethral obstruction could occur if a sufficient number of bladder polyps are located in the trigone of the bladder. Polyps originating or in the urethra may also cause partial or total obstruction. \u2022 Ureteral obstruction may occur if polyps surround the ureteral orifice. \u2022 UTI may be present concurrently, which can predispose to upper UTI.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 The volumes of urine produced and water consumed are controlled by interactions between the kidneys, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus through monitoring of plasma osmolality. Volume receptors within the atria and aortic arch also influence thirst and urine production. PU may occur when the quantity of functional antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesized in the hypothalamus or released from the posterior pituitary is limited, or when the kidneys fail to respond normally to ADH. PD occurs when the thirst center in the anterior hypothalamus is stimulated. \u2022 In most PU patients, plasma becomes relatively hypertonic and activates thirst mechanisms; the PD maintains hydration as a compensatory response. Occasionally PD is the primary process and PU is compensatory. In this case, the patient\u2019s plasma becomes relatively hypotonic because of excessive water intake, ADH secretion is reduced, resulting in PU.

The pathophysiology of the pregnancy edema syndrome in the dog has not yet been established. Hydrops allantois and hydrops amnii have been reported in mares and cows. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Edema can occur secondary to venous/ lymphatic compression from an enlarged, gravid uterus. \u2022 In humans, pregnancy edema can be normal (80%), or can be associated with preeclampsia, pregnancy toxemia, and eclampsia (proteinuric hypertension); a placental trigger is suspected (immunologic). \u2022 During normal pregnancy total body water increases both extracellularly and interstitially. There is also cumulative retention of sodium distributed between the maternal extracellular compartments and the fetus. Changes in factors governing renal sodium and water handling accompany alterations in local Starling forces whereby there is a moderate fall in interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure and a rise in capillary hydrostatic pressure, as well as changes in hydration of connective tissue.

Chronic Prostatitis Subclinical infection of the canine prostate in absence of prostatic abscessation and polysystemic signs. Affected animals are asymptomatic except for inflammatory exudate in the prostatic fluid, which causes infertility. Chronic prostatitis may occur after or independently of acute prostatitis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Predisposing pathology is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which occurs under the influence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in more than 80% of intact male dogs >5 years of age (see Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia). \u2022 Infection of the hypertrophied canine prostate develops most commonly from ascending flora\u2014rarely from blood-borne bacteria or from penetrating wounds. The prostate of intact dogs constantly secretes prostatic fluid, which is deposited into the prostatic urethra and then flows into the urinary bladder and out of the penile urethra. With prostatitis, prostatic fluid containing blood, inflammatory exudate, and microorganisms is deposited into the urinary bladder and discharged intermittently from the tip of the penis.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Under physiologic conditions, two-thirds of normal protein loss in dogs occurs through the small intestine. \u2022 Plasma proteins that leak into the GI lumen are rapidly digested into constituent amino acids that can be reabsorbed and used for the synthesis of new proteins. \u2022 This normal loss of plasma proteins can be accelerated by GI mucosal disease or by increased leakage of lymph into the GI lumen. \u2022 GI protein loss is associated with loss of both albumin and globulin, often resulting in panhypoproteinemia. \u2022 In response to increased GI protein loss, the liver increases albumin synthesis. However, the liver cannot increase albumin synthesis to more than twice the normal output. \u2022 When protein loss exceeds protein synthesis, hypoproteinemia results. \u2022 Hypoproteinemia causes decreased plasma oncotic pressure, which may lead to hemodynamic changes, effusion into body cavities or peripheral edema. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Coagulation\u2014patients with PLE lose antithrombin and other anticoagulants, resulting in a hypercoagulable state which may lead to thromboembolic events such as pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). \u2022 GI\u2014primary GI disease may be associated with diarrhea, vomiting, or weight loss. \u2022 Hemodynamic\u2014 decreased oncotic pressure leading to cavitary effusion. \u2022 Lymphatic\u2014lymphangiectasia. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014dyspnea due to pleural effusion or PTE. \u2022 Skin\u2014subcutaneous edema.

The pathogenesis of edema involves both inappropriate renal sodium retention and decreased plasma oncotic pressure. GENETICS Familial nephropathies associated with glomerular proteinuria have been described in several breeds of dogs; in only a few has the mode of inheritance been established: Samoyed (X-linked), English cocker spaniel (autosomal recessive), bull terrier (autosomal dominant), Dalmatian (autosomal dominant), Bernese mountain dog (autosomal recessive), Brittany spaniel (autosomal recessive), bullmastiff (autosomal recessive), Newfoundland (autosomal recessive), soft-coated wheaten terrier (complex), Chinese shar-pei (suspect autosomal recessive). Doberman pinscher, Rottweiler, Pembroke Welsh corgi, beagle, English foxhound, and others. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 In a study of urinalysis data from 500 dogs, the prevalence of proteinuria was approximately 19%. \u2022 The prevalence of MA was 25% in dogs and 25% in cats. Prevalence increased with advancing age. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None, however an association may be observed with some infectious diseases that are regional. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Glomerular proteinuria may be the initial manifestation of several familial renal diseases (see Genetics). Mean Age and Range Proteinuria can occur at any age. Familial renal diseases tend to occur in younger animals; acquired glomerular proteinuria more likely in middle-aged or older animals Predominant Sex Varies with different diseases SIGNS \u2022 Vary with underlying cause and severity of proteinuria. \u2022 Patients with glomerular proteinuria are frequently asymptomatic or have signs attributable to underlying diseases. Historical Findings \u2022 Weight loss and lethargy; animals with pulmonary thromboembolism may have acute dyspnea. \u2022 Patients with lower urinary tract (LUT) disorders may have dysuria, pollakiuria, inappropriate urination, and/or hematuria. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May have edema or abdominal distention. \u2022 May have oral ulceration (if uremic), edema or cavitary effusion, or changes in pulse quality (if thromboembolic). CAUSES Prerenal Proteinuria Overload proteinuria\u2014tubular resorptive capacity exceeded by large amounts of low-molecular-weight plasma proteins in glomerular filtrate (e.g., excessive hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, neoplastic production of paraproteins or Bence Jones proteins). Renal Proteinuria \u2022 Functional proteinuria\u2014strenuous exercise, fever, hypothermia, seizures, or venous congestion. \u2022 Glomerulonephritis (e.g., immune complex-mediated, membranous, membranoproliferative, proliferative), minimal change disease, hereditary nephritis, amyloidosis, podocyopathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis. \u2022 All glomerular diseases can be associated with severe proteinuria, subsets of immune complex-mediated (particularly membranoproliferative and membranous) may be associated with higher magnitude proteinuria than others. \u2022 Tubular dysfunction resulting in failure of tubular protein reabsorption is associated with mild-to-moderate proteinuria. Postrenal Proteinuria Hemorrhage or inflammation of the urogenital tract. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Chronic inflammatory (e.g., infectious and immune-mediated) and neoplastic diseases can lead to development of glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis. Examples include dirofilariasis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, babesiosis, chronic bacterial infections (e.g., endocarditis, pyoderma), pyometra, bartonellosis, feline immunodeficiency virus, mast cell tumor, lymphosarcoma, hyperadrenocorticism, and systemic lupus erythematosus. \u2022 Systemic hypertension. \u2022 Chronic hyperlipidemia. \u2022 Multiple myeloma can produce Bence Jones proteinuria.", "Protothecosis": " Algal infection in warm-blooded animals.

Cats \u2022 Large cutaneous nodules on the face or limbs. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Prototheca wickerhamii and P. zopfii (genotype 1 and 2 )\u2014 single-celled achlorophyllous blue-green algae (Chlorophyta). \u2022 Dogs\u2014usually P. zopfii (75-90%); P. wickerhamii infection may also occur. \u2022 Cats\u2014usually P. wickerhamii . \u2022 Basis for the pathogenicity of Prototheca spp. unknown; likely traumatic inoculation. \u2022 Organism\u2014ecological niche is sewage; contaminants of water, soil, and food; occasionally isolated from fecal samples. \u2022 Dogs and humans\u2014depressed cell-mediated immunity may predispose to infection.", "Pruritus": " Pruritus (itch) is an unpleasant sensation that causes the clinical symptom of scratching, rubbing, hair pulling, and/or licking. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Keratinocytes, mast cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes interact with neuronal cells via the release of cytokines, neurotrophins, and neuropeptides. The sensation of itch is conducted via the peripheral nervous system to the sensory cortex. Other factors can modify the perception of pruritus at this level. Pruritus is an adaptive protective mechanism, however excessive itch can lead to cutaneous damage. Identification and treatment or removal of the causative agent(s) is the most important aspect of long-term control. Avoidance or reduction of long-term medical therapy should be pursued when possible. Chronic cases may be best handled by a dermatologist. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Skin/exocrine/neuronal. \u2022 Behavioral. SIGNS \u2022 Scratching, licking, biting, rubbing, hair pull, or chewing. \u2022 Variable evidence of self-trauma and cutaneous inflammation. \u2022 Non-well-demarcated alopecia with or without excoriations, and without obvious gross inflammation may be the only sign.

SIGNALMENT Any species may be affected, but dogs are most commonly involved in accidental overdoses. SIGNS \u2022 Mydriasis, panting, hyperthermia, agitation/hyperactivity, tachycardia, hypertension are common. Other signs include vomiting, vocalization, tremors, disorientation, or lethargy. \u2022 Head-bobbing, sinus arrhythmias, scleral hemorrhage, or seizure-like activity are possible. Acute collapse may follow. \u2022 Signs of acute intoxication may persist 1\u20133 days, depending on dose ingested. \u2022 Severe cases may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), myoglobinuremia/uria with secondary renal injury, or permanent CNS dysfunction. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Pseudoephedrine is a synthetic salt of ephedrine and is an indirect sympathomimetic amine. \u2022 Phenylephrine is a synthetic sympathomimetic amine chemically related to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Phenylephrine has poor oral bioavailability and generally will have less severe cardiovascular effects than pseudoephedrine. \u2022 Pseudoephedrine indirectly stimulates alpha- and, to a lesser degree, beta-adrenergic receptors. \u2022 Pseudoephedrine dosages >1 mg/kg can result in agitation, hyperactivity, and panting. \u2022 Phenylephrine dosages >3\u20134 mg/kg may cause vomiting, lethargy or hyperactivity, hypertension, and tachycardia. \u2022 Head-bobbing, DIC, or myoglobinuria indicate serious intoxication and a more guarded prognosis.", "Pseudomacrothrombocytopenia (Inherited Macrothrombocytopenia)": " \u2022 A common cause of thrombocytopenia and increased mean platelet volume (MPV) in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS), and infrequently in other breeds. \u2022 Caused by an inherited mutation that impairs platelet maturation, resulting in the early release of platelets from the bone marrow. The released platelets are significantly larger than normal. \u2022 Overall platelet mass (product of platelet number and average size) is unaffected, therefore clinical signs of hypocoagulability are not seen. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs\u2014primarily CKCS with infrequent reports in Norfolk terriers, Cairn terriers, English toy spaniels, and Jack Russell terriers; other breeds also sporadically affected. \u2022 A similar condition is also reported in Akitas, although a specific mutation has not yet been identified in this breed. \u2022 The condition is present from birth, but is often not detected until a CBC is performed. The mutation is autosomal, therefore there is no sex predilection. SIGNS Not associated with clinical signs; often incidentally noted on a CBC performed for other reasons. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Caused by point mutations in the gene encoding \u03b2 1-tubulin, which is involved in platelet formation. The mutations impair the formation of microtubules in the megakaryocyte (platelet precursor) and result in the release of lower numbers of platelets that are larger than normal. \u2022 The condition is inherited in an autosomal fashion, with homozygotes exhibiting moderate to marked thrombocytopenia and moderate to marked increases in MPV. Heterozygotes are less severely affected and may have a mild thrombocytopenia and/or mild increase in MPV. \u2022 In the United States, it has been estimated that approximately 47% of CKCS are homozygous for the mutation and 45% are heterozygous.", "Ptyalism": " \u2022 Excessive production and secretion of saliva (see Web Figure 1). \u2022 Pseudoptyalism is the excessive release of saliva that has accumulated in the oral cavity due to inability to swallow. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Saliva is constantly produced and secreted into the oral cavity from the salivary glands. \u2022 Saliva production increases when salivary nuclei in the brainstem are stimulated. \u2022 Higher centers in the CNS can excite or inhibit salivary nuclei. \u2022 Taste and tactile stimuli in the oral cavity increase saliva production. \u2022 Physiologic hypersalivation may occur with: anticipation of eating, hyperthermia and purring (cats). \u2022 Saliva production may be increased with gastrointestinal (GI) or CNS disorders.

Double- chambered RV is a variant of subvalvular pulmonic stenosis (PS) characterized by a focal muscular or fibromuscular stenosis in the mid RV. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The stenosis causes a pressure overload of the RV, resulting in concentric hypertrophy. The RV develops high systolic pressures to overcome the stenosis, whose magnitude correlates with the severity of the stenosis. The difference between the high right ventricular pressure and the normal PA pressure (i.e., the pressure gradient) is often used to describe the severity of the stenosis. Hypertrophy of the RV increases the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. The geometric changes in the RV can result in secondary tricuspid insufficiency, although tricuspid insufficiency can also be associated with concurrent tricuspid dysplasia. Syncope can occur with exercise, as the RV may be unable to increase stroke volume adequately. Tricuspid insufficiency with or without myocardial failure of the RV can lead to high right atrial pressures and right-sided congestive heart failure (R-CHF). A concurrent atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale can cause right-to-left shunting, especially with exercise, resulting in cyanosis on exertion. Mild PS usually produces no significant hemodynamic effects apart from an ejection murmur. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014R-CHF, arrhythmias. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014hepatomegaly with R-CHF. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014pleural effusion. \u2022 Nervous\u2014cerebral hypoperfusion during exercise.

SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections English bulldog, Chihuahua, French bulldog, miniature schnauzer, West Highland white terrier, Samoyed, cocker spaniel, beagle, boxer, Pomeranian, German shepherd dog, whippet. Bulldog breeds are particularly predisposed to PS caused by anomalous coronary artery anatomy, where the left coronary artery originates from the same vessel as the right coronary, and causes stenosis as it wraps around the main PA.

Playbiting A normal behavior, but rough play, teasing, and encouraging the pet to bite hands and feet may contribute to problems Getting on Counters/Furniture \u2022 Insufficient outlets for normal play and exploration. \u2022 Tempting objects or food left on counters/ furniture. \u2022 Desire for social interaction. \u2022 No acceptable alternative resting/bedding area. RISK FACTORS See Causes.", "Puppy Socialization and Puppy Classes": " \u2022 Early experiences set the foundation for future behavior, having lasting effects on social behavior, temperament, and the ability to learn and relate to various stimuli and to cope in various environmental contexts. \u2022 To grow up into a well-adjusted adult dog, adequate socialization and environmental exposure is needed during the socialization period and beyond into the first year of life. Definitions \u2022 Socialization\u2014a process of learning normal behavior, communication, and social skills for appropriate interactions with other individuals in various contexts. \u2022 Socialization period\u2014a sensitive window of development whereby a dog learns to communicate and relate to other dogs, humans, and the environment. \u2022 Puppy classes\u2014called socialization, preschool, or kindergarten classes. Allow dogs to socialize with other dogs, breeds, a variety of people and to be exposed to multiple and varied environmental stimuli in a positive and nonthreatening manner. Pathophysiology Potential effects on behavioral and neurological development. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs Breed Predilections \u2022 Smaller breeds may mature faster and progress more quickly through windows of behavioral development. \u2022 Amount of handling and exposure toward humans needed to reduce people-shyness may be genetically variable. \u2022 The timing of first fear response is genetically variable, 39\u201355 days. Mean Age and Range \u2022 The primary socialization period is between 3 and 5 weeks. Puppies recognize kin and learn to relate and interact with other members of their species. The secondary socialization period occurs from 6 to 12 weeks, during this time most puppies are removed from its mother and littermates and raised with human caregivers. The ideal time for placement in a new home is probably after 7 or 8 weeks of age. \u2022 For puppy classes\u2014healthy dewormed puppies should begin attending group socialization classes 10 days after receiving their first vaccine of their immunization series. Typical age at time of the first classes is between 8 and 12 weeks. Predominant Sex Male puppies play more than females. SIGNS \u2022 Lack of adequate socialization experiences during sensitive periods of development. \u2022 Dog-directed fear and/or aggression\u2014lack of early familiarity and positive exposure results in fear and aggression or reactivity to unfamiliar dogs. \u2022 Human-directed fear and/or aggression\u2014 exposure with humans prior to 14 weeks is necessary, otherwise fear, avoidance, aggression, and behaving as if \u201cferal.\u201d \u2022 Predatory aggression\u2014social exposure, even to prey species, can reduce predatory behavior later in life. \u2022 Reduced ability to copulate\u2014in male dogs, lack of socialization toward conspecifics from 3 weeks on results in the display of normal sexual behavior toward estrus females, but poor performance. In female dogs, timidity toward other dogs may preclude breeding. \u2022 Fear and anxiety in unfamiliar environments with various sights, sounds, and smells. \u2022 Attendance at group puppy classes during sensitive periods of development can prevent future behavior problems and/or allow for the early identification of abnormal and problematic behavior. \u2022 Puppy socialization classes\u2014age specific (to begin at 8\u201312 weeks) for group-controlled interactions. Focus is education on normal behavior, prevention of behavior problems, and addressing problem behaviors through management, supervision, and positive reinforcement training. \u2022 Group classes of older puppies in their juvenile (3\u20136 months) and adolescent (6\u201318 months) stages. Focus primarily on training manners, positive reinforcement training and teaching dogs to focus on their owners/handlers. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Avoiding environmental and social experiences prior to the completion of puppy vaccination series increases the risk of future behavior problems. \u2022 Risk of contracting parvovirus was not increased when puppies attended well-run group socialization classes prior to completion of their vaccination series. \u2022 Risks of exposure to infectious disease with socialization needs to be considered along with the risk of being undersocialized and not suitable as a pet because of fear, anxiety, and/or aggression. \u2022 Along with a clean bill of health, initial vaccinations must have been administered at least 1 week and preferably 10 days before puppy socialization classes start. \u2022 Puppies should be dewormed according to the Companion Animal Parasite Council guidelines: https://capcvet.org/guidelines/ general-guidelines/ \u2022 Puppies should be free of clinical disease such as respiratory and gastrointestinal prior to each class. \u2022 Puppy socialization with people and dogs is only beneficial to behavioral development if the puppy finds human and/or dog contact enjoyable. Forced exposure, when it induces fear, is likely to exacerbate fear and/or aggression. \u2022 Experiences at the veterinary clinic should employ Fear Free \u00ae and Low Stress techniques to prevent fear, anxiety, stress, and aggression during future veterinary visits. \u2022 Overly shy, fearful, reactive or hyperactive puppies during routine veterinary health checks are likely to display the same behavior at 1 year of age. \u2022 Puppies displaying fear and avoidance of being handled are likely to display fear and/or aggression with handling later in life. \u2022 Excessive mouthing/biting or aggression over food resources at 8 weeks may indicate increased risk of aggression toward family members. \u2022 Pet store puppies and those with early illness are more likely to develop behavior problems. \u2022 Traumatic fear-inducing experiences, particularly during sensitive fear periods, between 8 and 10 weeks and between 6 and 12 months (lasting up to 3 weeks), should be avoided. \u2022 Removal from the mother and littermates prior to 6 weeks may increase the risk of separation anxiety and interdog aggression with poor interdog social skills. \u2022 Avoiding exposure to other species during socialization can lead to fear or aggression towards the species. \u2022 At the juvenile period, beginning at 3\u20134 months of age, puppies may become less social and more fearful with increased independence seen in adolescence.", "Puppy Strangles (Juvenile Cellulitis)": " \u2022 Uncommon granulomatous and pustular disorder of puppies. \u2022 Rarely seen in adult dogs. \u2022 Affects primarily the face, pinnae, and submandibular lymph nodes. \u2022 Immunopathogenesis unknown.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Unknown\u2014an immune dysfunction with a heritable cause is suspected.", "Pyelonephritis": " Microbial colonization of the upper urinary tract, including the renal pelvis, collecting diverticula, renal parenchyma, and ureters; because it is not usually limited to the renal pelvis and parenchyma, a more descriptive term is upper urinary tract infection (UTI); this chapter is limited to bacterial pyelonephritis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Infection of any portion of the urinary tract usually requires impairment of normal host defenses against UTI (see Lower Urinary Tract Infection chapters); normal defenses against ascending UTI include mucosal defense barriers, ureteral peristalsis, ureterovesical flap valves, unidirectional flow of urine, and an extensive renal blood supply. Pyelonephritis usually occurs by ascension of microbes causing lower UTI. Hematogenous seeding of the kidneys is an uncommon cause of pyelonephritis. Regardless of the route of infection, an upper UTI is frequently accompanied by lower UTI. \u2022 Pyelonephritis can develop secondarily to infected nephroliths. Upper UTI with urease-producing bacteria can predispose to struvite nephroliths (see Urolithiasis, Struvite\u2014Dogs). \u2022 Obstruction of an infected kidney or ureter can rapidly cause septicemia (urosepsis). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Renal/urologic. \u2022 Can cause urosepsis, thus affecting any body system. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Unknown. \u2022 Probably occurs more commonly than is recognized clinically, because many animals with pyelonephritis are asymptomatic or have signs limited to lower UTI. SIGNALMENT Species Detected more frequently in dog than cat. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Dogs of any age can be affected. \u2022 Cats\u2014UTI is uncommon in young to middle-age cats. UTI is more common in cats >10 years of age. Predominant Sex UTI affects females more commonly than males. SIGNS General Comments Differentiation between pyelonephritis, subclinical bacteriuria, and lower UTI may be difficult in some patients. Historical Findings \u2022 Polyuria/polydipsia. \u2022 Abdominal or lumbar pain (uncommon). \u2022 Signs associated with lower UTI may predominate\u2014e.g., dysuria, pollakiuria, periuria, stranguria, hematuria, and malodorous or discolored urine. \u2022 Signs attributable to chronic kidney disease (CKD)\u2014e.g., polyuria/polydipsia, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May lack specific signs related to upper UTI. \u2022 Fever. \u2022 Pain upon palpation of kidneys. \u2022 One or both kidneys may be reduced in size with chronic pyelonephritis, or kidneys may be increased in size with acute pyelo - nephritis. CAUSES Usually, ascending UTI caused by aerobic bacteria; most common isolates are Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp.; other bacteria, including Proteus , Streptococcus , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , and Pseudomonas spp., which frequently infect the lower urinary tract, may ascend into the upper urinary tract. Anaerobic bacteria, ureaplasma, and fungi uncommonly infect the upper urinary tract. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Ectopic ureters, vesicoureteral reflux, congenital renal dysplasia, and lower UTI. \u2022 Conditions that predispose to bacteriuria\u2014 e.g., diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, exogenous steroid administration, CKD, indwelling urinary catheters, urine retention, uroliths, urinary tract neoplasia, perineal urethrostomy.", "Pyoderma": " \u2022 Bacterial infection of the skin. \u2022 Surface bacterial infections\u2014often referred to as a \u201chot spot;\u201d represents an acute moist dermatitis involving the surface of the skin. \u2022 Superficial pyoderma\u2014involves the epidermis and the intact hair follicle; includes mucocutaneous pyoderma. \u2022 Deep pyoderma\u2014involves the dermis and possibly subcutis; furunculosis is often present; patients can be systemically ill. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Skin infections occur when the surface barrier of the skin has been broken, the skin has become macerated by chronic exposure to moisture, the population of resident bacterial flora has been altered, circulation has been impaired, and/or immunocompetency of the patient has been negatively impacted by systemic illness or immunosuppressive therapy. \u2022 Pyoderma is usually secondary to an underlying cause; the primary, underlying cause should be identified and managed to reduce the frequency and recurrence of skin infections.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Incompletely understood and multifactorial. \u2022 Classic theory\u2014repeated exposure of endometrium to high concentrations of estrogen during proestrus and estrus followed by high concentrations of progesterone during diestrus without pregnancy leads to development of cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), which predisposes uterus to ascending bacterial infections. \u2022 Strains of Escherichia coli with uropathogenic virulence factors that allow adhesion to the endometrium and establishment of an infection without CEH enter uterus during proestrus and estrus and act as a mucosal irritant stimulating development of CEH under the influence of progesterone. Uterine secretions may act as a growth medium for ascending bacteria. \u2022 Regardless of underlying cause, pyometra does not occur in absence of progesterone (endogeneous or exogeneous). SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Reproductive. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune. GENETICS \u2022 Genetic predisposition suspected in some related bitches. \u2022 Suggested breed predisposition in Bernese mountain dog, Rottweiler, rough\u00adcoated collie, oriental cat breeds. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Accurate assessment difficult because most dogs and cats in the United States undergo elective ovariohysterectomy (OHE). A recent Swedish study reported overall incidence of pyometra in bitches as 199 per 10,000 dogs at risk and in queens as 17 per 10,000 cats at risk. Lower incidence in queens because they are induced ovulators. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Mean Age and Range Usually >6 years old; range 4 months to 16 years; mean 7.25 years.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Infective form of P. insidiosum is thought to be a motile biflagellate zoospore, which is released into warm water environments and is chemotactically attracted to damaged tissue and animal hair; animals likely infected when they enter or ingest water containing infective zoospores. \u2022 P. insidiosum considered pathogenic rather than opportunistic because immune suppression is not prerequisite for infection. \u2022 In GI tract, P. insidiosum causes chronic pyogranulomatous disease with severe segmental transmural thickening of one or more areas of stomach or intestine. \u2022 In skin, pythiosis typically causes nonhealing wounds and invasive masses that contain ulcerated nodules and draining tracts. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 GI and cutaneous forms of disease encountered with equal frequency in dogs; cats are infrequently infected, cutaneous form more common. \u2022 With exception of occasional dissemination to regional lymph nodes, pythiosis usually affects only one body system in each patient; multisystemic involvement rare. \u2022 GI pythiosis most often affects gastric outflow tract, proximal small intestine, ileocolic junction, colon, and mesentery; esophagus rarely affected. \u2022 In dogs, GI disease, local thromboembolic events, or vascular invasion may lead to bowel wall ischemia, GI perforation, or hemoabdomen. \u2022 Dogs with cutaneous pythiosis are often presented for solitary or multiple cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions involving extremities, tailhead, ventral neck, perineum. \u2022 In cats, cutaneous lesions or subcutaneous masses involving retrobulbar, periorbital, or nasopharyngeal regions, tailhead, or footpads have been observed. GENETICS Large\u00adbreed dogs most often affected; no genetic predisposition documented.

Reflux refers to the retrograde movement of gastric juice across the gastro - esophageal sphincter into the esophagus. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Regurgitation results from a loss of normal esophageal motility. In the normal esophagus, the presence of a food bolus in the proximal esophagus stimulates afferent sensory neurons. Signals are transferred centrally, via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, to the tractus solitarius and nucleus ambiguus. Motor impulses travel back via the vagus nerve to stimulate striated muscle (canine) and striated and smooth muscle (feline) to cause esophageal peristalsis. Lesions anywhere along this pathway may lead to regurgitation. Esophagitis secondary to reflux can cause esophageal dysmotility and subsequent regurgitation. Delayed gastric emptying is a common and underappreciated cause of reflux and possible regurgitation. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014dysphagia, weight loss. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014weakness, weight loss. \u2022 Nervous\u2014polyneuropathies, CNS disease. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014aspiration pneumonia. GENETICS \u2022 Regurgitation due to megaesophagus can be inherited in smooth fox terriers (autosomal recessive) and miniature schnauzers (autosomal dominant or 60% penetrance autosomal recessive). In addition, Jack Russell terriers, springer spaniels, long-haired miniature dachshunds, golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and Samoyeds are predisposed to the congenital form of myasthenia gravis. A breed predisposition for acquired megaesophagus also exists for the German shepherd dog, Great Dane, Irish setter, Labrador retriever, pug, and Chinese Shar-Pei. The site and patho genesis of the lesion in idiopathic megaeso phagus is unknown. Suggested hypotheses include abnormalities of the afferent limb of the reflex arc (receptors, neurons) or of the swallowing center in the CNS. \u2022 Boxers and Newfoundlands have a genetic predisposi tion for inflammatory myopathy that is associated with esophageal dysmotility. \u2022 Brachycephalic breeds are predisposed to sliding hiatal hernias (type I) that is typically associated with gastroesophageal reflux and regurgitation.

Mean Age and Range \u2022 Congenital cases present soon after birth (congenital megaesophagus) or at weaning (vascular ring anomalies) during the transition from liquid diet to solid foods. \u2022 Acquired cases may be seen at any age, depending on the etiology. Predominant Sex No gender predilection has been identified.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Subretinal space\u2014a potential space between RPE and neural retina in which fluid or exudates accumulate. \u2022 Etiopathogenesis is one or a combination of rhegmatogenous (retinal tear), subretinal exudation, or traction. Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD) A tear or hole in retina related to age, cataracts, traction from inflammatory debris or vitreal degeneration, trauma, or retinal degeneration. Vitreous fluid moves into the subretinal space, resulting in detachment. Probably the predominant type occurring in association with cataracts and after cataract or lens surgery. Exudative \u2022 Fluid accumulates in the subretinal space because of breakdown of blood\u2013retinal barrier. \u2022 Subretinal fluid\u2014serous, hemorrhagic, or exudative. \u2022 Hematogenous/ systemic pathogenetic factors\u2014common. \u2022 Vasculitis, hypertension, and hyperviscosity\u2014 may cause serous detachment with or without hemorrhage.

First-generation anticoagulants, such as warfarin, are generally less toxic and shorter acting than second-generation which tend to persist longer in the liver and require 3\u20134 weeks of antidote therapy. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Anticoagulant rodenticides inhibit vitamin K1 epoxide reductase, DT-diaphorase, and possibly other enzymes involved in the reduction of vitamin K1 epoxide to vitamin K1. \u2022 Vitamin K1 is required for carboxylation of clotting factors II, VI, IX, and X; uncarboxylated clotting factors do not bind calcium sufficiently to participate in clot formation. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune. \u2022 Respiratory. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Still common but fewer exposures. \u2022 In 2011, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of secondgeneration anticoagulants (i.e., brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone) for residential use unless placed by a pest control operator. \u2022 In 2013, the EPA gave notice of cancelling registration and denial of future applications for certain rodenticide products including warfarin, brodifacoum, and difethialone. In response, manufacturers have begun the process of transition to non-anticoagulant baits such as bromethalin and cholecalciferol. SIGNALMENT No breed or gender predilections; younger animals may ingest bait more readily. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 May be slightly more prevalent in the spring and fall when rodenticide products are used. \u2022 Clinical signs typically begin 3\u20135 days after ingestion. Early signs maybe noted at 48 hours. Historical Findings \u2022 Use of anticoagulant rodenticides. \u2022 Evidence of rodenticide dye in vomitus or feces. \u2022 Coughing, dyspnea, tachypnea, or exercise intolerance are often the first clinical signs. \u2022 Bleeding from body orifices; subcutaneous or joint swelling, petechiation of the skin and gums may also be observed. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Evidence of hemorrhagic shock (i.e., tachycardia, hypovolemia, hypotension, poor pulse quality, pallor). \u2022 Coughing, dyspnea, tachypnea, pale mucous membranes. \u2022 Hematomas\u2014often ventral and at venipuncture sites; subcutaneous hematomas. \u2022 Bleeding from body orifices, periorbital bleeding, scleral hemorrhage. \u2022 Hemarthrosis, lameness. \u2022 Exercise intolerance, lethargy, depression. \u2022 Muffled heart or lung sounds. \u2022 Distended abdomen (hemoabdomen). CAUSES Ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticides or, rarely, ingestion of prey that have been exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides (see Risk Factors). RISK FACTORS \u2022 Dogs are much more sensitive to anticoagulant rodenticides than cats. \u2022 Small doses over several days may add up to a toxic dose. \u2022 Secondary or relay toxicosis by consumption of poisoned rodents is possible but unlikely. \u2022 There is a wide range of toxicity between anticoagulant rodenticides. In general, if the ingestion exceeds 1/5\u20131/10 the LD 50 , decontamination and monitoring for coagulopathy are indicated. \u2022 Dogs: \u26ac Brodifacoum, LD 50 0.25\u20132.5 mg/kg. \u26ac Bromadiolone, LD 50 11\u201320 mg/kg. \u26ac Chlorophacinone, LD 50 50\u2013100 mg/kg. \u26ac Difethialone, LD 50 4 mg/kg. \u26ac Diphacinone, LD 50 3\u20137.5 mg/kg. \u26ac Warfarin, LD 50 20\u201350 mg/kg. \u2022 Cats: \u26ac Brodifacoum, LD 50 25 mg/kg. \u26ac Bromadiolone, LD 50 >25 mg/kg. \u26ac Difethiolone, LD 50 >16 mg/kg.", "Rodenticide Toxicosis\u2014Bromethalin": " \u2022 Bromethalin is a neurotoxic rodenticide that produces cerebral edema and elevated CSF pressure, resulting in progressive CNS depression, coma, paresis, and paralysis. \u2022 Clinical signs and death have been reported in dogs and cats exposed to bromethalin at doses as low as 0.36 and 0.24 mg/kg, respectively. \u2022 Trade names include Tomcat, Fastrac, Top Gun, Gladiator, and others.

Available as zinc, aluminum, and magnesium salts. \u2022 Distinctive odor, often described as acetylene, rotten fish, or garlic. \u2022 Most common route of exposure is ingestion; however, toxicosis can occur via inhalation and absorption through broken skin. \u2022 Hydrolysis leads to phosphine gas production. Phosphine gas has corrosive and irritant effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, which leads to vomiting, hematemesis, or melena. The gas is rapidly absorbed and systemically distributed leading to effects on other organ systems. \u2022 Phosphine leads to the production of free radicals and oxidative stress, causing direct cellular damage and may inhibit cellular respiration. \u2022 Toxic exposure is reported to be 20\u201340 mg/kg; however, the gastric pH is reported to affect toxicity.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Cryptorchidism", "Separation Anxiety Syndrome": " A distress response of dogs (occasionally cats) separated from the person or persons to whom they are most attached, usually their owner(s). The separation may be real (the owner is gone) or perceived (pet is separated from the owner). In other cases the pet may be distressed because a fear-inducing event has occurred while home alone (e.g., thunderstorms, loud noises or home invasions), resulting in distress responses during subsequent departures. Distress may be exhibited as destruction, vocalization, and elimination in the owner\u2019s absence. Separation anxiety is a subset of separation-related problems that may have different underlying motivations, including fear, anxiety, overattachment to owner(s), and lack of appropriate stimulation or interactions. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Unknown but suspected changes in brain pathology due to aging, anxious temperament, noise or location phobias, insecure attachment to humans in family. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral\u2014escape attempts, howling, whining, depression, hyperactivity. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014tachycardia. \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014increased cortisol, stress-induced hyperglycemia. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014inappetence, diarrhea, vomiting \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014self-induced trauma from escape attempts. \u2022 Nervous\u2014adrenergic/noradrenergic overstimulation. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea. \u2022 Skin/exocrine\u2014acral lick dermatitis. \u2022 Oral\u2014dental damage during escape attempts. GENETICS None known. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE It is speculated that 13\u201328% of companion dogs experience some degree of separation anxiety. May be different underlying pathology with young dogs and senior dogs. SIGNALMENT Species Primarily dogs; possible in cats. Mean Age and Range Any age, most commonly in dogs >6 months; may be another increase in prevalence in dogs >8 years. Predominant Sex Male and neutered male dogs overrepresented in recent studies. SIGNS General Comments Destruction, vocalization, and elimination in the absence of the owner alone are not diagnostic for separation distress. Historical Findings \u2022 Destruction, vocalization (whining, howling, barking), and indoor elimination. Destruction targets windows and doors and/or owner possessions. \u2022 Other signs include behavioral depression, anorexia, drooling, hiding, shaking, panting, pacing, attempts to prevent owner departure, and self-trauma from lick lesions. Diarrhea and vomiting are occasionally seen. \u2022 Signs of strong pet\u2013owner attachment may be present: excessive attention-seeking behaviors and following behaviors are not necessary for diagnosis and do not occur in all patients. \u2022 Frequently owners report excessive, excited, and prolonged greeting behavior upon return. \u2022 Separation anxiety behavior(s) usually occurs regardless of the length of owner absence, often within 15\u201330 minutes of owner departure. \u2022 Specific triggers that are predictive of possible departure may initiate the anxiety response: getting keys, putting on outer garments, or packing the car but are not seen in all patients. \u2022 May occur on every departure and absence or only with atypical departures, e.g., after- work, evening, or weekend departures; the reverse pattern may also be seen. \u2022 Some animals may initially show signs in the presence of acute fear- or anxietyinducing events such as thunderstorms or fireworks when home alone but may recur with future departures even in the absence of stimuli. \u2022 In cats, elimination problems in the owner\u2019s absence may be linked to separation-related anxiety. \u2022 May be excessive water consumption upon owner return. \u2022 Distress may also be initiated by a change in daily routine or in the household (e.g., moving house). \u2022 What appears as distress may also be frustration at being alone, being confined, inability to pursue other activities, living in an impoverished environment or lack of enrichment. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Usually normal. \u2022 Injuries may be incurred in escape attempts or destructive activities. \u2022 Skin lesions from excessive licking. \u2022 Rare cases of dehydration from drooling or diarrhea due to stress.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 With severe infection, immune system is stimulated by pathogen-associated products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Gramnegative bacteria); lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, bacterial DNA, exotoxins (Gram-positive bacteria); fungal cell walls; flagellin (protozoans). \u2022 Macrophage-derived cytokines activate and recruit neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, activate coagulation cascade, increase capillary permeability. \u2022 Activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) produces large quantities of nitric oxide, causing diffuse, profound vasodilation; refractory hypotension or vasodilatory shock may result. \u2022 White blood cells (WBCs) and platelets at sites of inflammation activate coagulation, produce thrombin, and activate platelets; anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways inhibited. Procoagulant state favors microthrombi that can lead to decreased tissue oxygen delivery, multiple organ dysfunction, and organ failure. Progression to a hypocoagulable state can occur. \u2022 Cryptic shock\u2014decreased microcirculatory perfusion despite normal global hemodynamic parameters; results from decreased functional capillary density. \u2022 Endothelial cell dysfunction\u2014 disruption of endothelial glycocalyx, changes in deformability of red blood cells (RBCs), WBC activation, microthrombosis, loss of vascular smooth muscle autoregulation, changes in capillary permeability. \u2022 Cytopathic hypoxia\u2014sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction renders cells unable to use oxygen to make ATP. \u2022 Bacteremia\u2014may be transient and subclinical or escalate to overt sepsis when immune system overwhelmed; generally of more pathologic significance when source is venous or lymphatic drainage sites.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Most often associated with mild inflammatory CNS disease.", "Shock, Cardiogenic": " \u2022 Severe manifestation of forward heart failure in which patients have both clinical and biochemical evidence of inadequate tissue perfusion. \u2022 Profound impairment of cardiac function resulting in poor cardiac output and life-threatening end-organ hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the presence of adequate intravascular volume and systemic vascular resistance. \u2022 Cardiac impairment may result from systolic dysfunction (dilated cardiomyopathy, sepsis, myocarditis, ischemia), diastolic dysfunction (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, tension pneumothorax/ mediastinum, restrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade), conduction defects and arrhythmias, valvular diseases, obstructive diseases, pulmonary thromboembolism, and structural defects. Understanding the underlying defect and its hemodynamic consequences is imperative to institute appropriate therapy. \u2022 In congestive heart failure (CHF), sometimes referred to as backward heart failure, the ventricle cannot adequately pump out the returning blood, resulting in systemic and/or pulmonary edema. This is in contrast to forward heart failure, when the heart is not pumping enough blood out to meet the needs of the body. Most, but not all, veterinary patients that present in cardiogenic shock will have concurrent CHF. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Decreased cardiac output leads to hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion. \u2022 Hypotension decreases coronary perfusion, resulting in ischemia that provokes further myocardial dysfunction. \u2022 Peripheral vasoconstriction increases myocardial work and exacerbates tissue ischemia and energy depletion, resulting in organ dysfunction.

RISK FACTORS No specific risk factors; caused by another condition.", "Shock, Septic": " Sepsis-induced hypotension, attributable to low systemic vascular resistance that persists despite adequate intravascular volume and cardiac output. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In sepsis, an elaborate interaction of inflammatory cells and mediators decreases systemic vascular resistance and provokes maldistribution of blood flow (distributive effect). Vasodilation is primarily mediated by increased nitric oxide and prostacyclin synthesis induced by endotoxin and inflammatory cytokine interaction with vascular endothelial cells. In the face of severe arterial vasodilation, cardiac output is insufficient to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. \u2022 Infectious agents trigger large-scale activation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils that interact with endothelial cells, inducing a generalized inflammatory response. Endothelial injury is a universal feature, mediated by cellular and humoral factors that increase capillary permeability, and fluid shifts out of the intravascular space. Presence of interstitial edema and microvascular sludging further compound oxygen delivery, and tissue hypoxia leads to organ failure and death. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014arterial vasodilation and maldistribution of blood flow with hypotension predominates; cardiac output frequently normal or high; however, myocardial dysfunction due to circulating factors can be important. \u2022 Nervous\u2014altered mental status. \u2022 Endocrine\u2014may have hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, or insufficient production of either corticosteroids or vasopressin. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, bacterial translocation. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014interstitial and alveolar edema due to enhanced microvascular permeability; hypercoagulopathy may result in pulmonary thromboembolism. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014 hepatocellular enzyme leakage, cholestasis, reduced bacterial clearance, hypoglycemia and abnormal synthesis. \u2022 Hemic\u2014microvascular thrombosis, hyper- and hypocoagulopathy. \u2022 Renal\u2014ischemic tubular damage, oliguria, acute kidney injury.

Predominant Sex Female SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Clinical signs vary from asymptomatic to weakness, syncope, collapse, and/or seizures. \u2022 Sudden death is infrequent. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Heart rate may be abnormally rapid or abnormally slow. \u2022 Pauses may be noted. \u2022 Some patients appear normal.  Figure 1. A continuous lead II rhythm strip (25 mm/s) recorded from a dog with sick sinus syndrome showing an ectopic atrial rhythm interrupted by several short pauses. The third pause initiates a paroxysm of supraventricular tachycardia (250 bpm) followed by asystole (6.6 seconds) terminated by a junctional escape complex. CAUSES \u2022 Idiopathic. \u2022 Familial in miniature schnauzers. \u2022 Metastatic disease. \u2022 Ischemic disease.", "Sinus Arrest and Sinoatrial Block": " \u2022 Sinus arrest\u2014a disorder of impulse formation caused by slowing or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity; failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time. P-P interval does not equal a multiple of basic P-P interval. \u2022 Sinoatrial block\u2014a disorder of impulse conduction; an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to depolarize the atria or does so with delay; most commonly the basic rhythmicity of the sinus node is not disturbed and the duration of the pause is a multiple of the basic P-P interval. Classified into first-, second-, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). Difficult to diagnose first- and third- degree SA block from electrocardiogram (ECG). Second-degree SA block most common: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) SA block\u2014 P-P interval progressively shortens prior to a pause; duration of pause is less than two P-P cycles; Mobitz type II SA block\u2014duration of pause occurring after a sinus beat is exact multiple (two, three, or four times normal) of basic P-P interval. ECG Features \u2022 A normal P wave exists for each QRS complex with a pause equal to or greater than twice the normal P-P interval; rhythm is regularly irregular or irregular with pauses (Figure 1). \u2022 Junctional or ventricular escape beats\u2014occur if pauses significantly prolonged. Subsidiary pacemaker takes over rhythm with escape beats normally from AV junctional tissue or Purkinje fibers; intermittent absence of P waves noted or P waves may be negative and precede, be superimposed on or follow the QRS complexes. \u2022 Surface ECG cannot differentiate sinus arrest from block in the dog because of normal R-R interval variation (sinus arrhythmia). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Sympathetic and parasympathetic influences can alter spontaneous sinus node depolarization; vagal stimulation of acetylcholine, which binds to SA nodal receptor sites, can slow automaticity of the sinus node by reducing the slope of phase 4 depolarization; sympathetic stimulation releases norepinephrine that binds to \u03b2 1 receptors on the SA node, enhancing spontaneous SA nodal discharge rate. \u2022 An overdrive inhibition phenomenon occurs when sinus arrest follows a run of ectopic beats. The sinus node requires a warming-up period until the usual rate of automaticity is reestablished. \u2022 Intrinsic disease of the sinus node may affect the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent traffic to the SA node and its spontaneous discharge rate. \u2022 Duration of sinus arrest may be long and possibly irreversible when the sinus node is suppressed by an ectopic tachycardia, particularly with severe underlying heart disease. Persistent sinus arrest that is not drug induced often indicates sick sinus syndrome (SSS). SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cardiovascular\u2014clinical signs of weakness or syncope may appear if sinus arrest or block causes sufficiently long periods (generally 5 seconds or longer) of ventricular asystole with no escape beats initiated by latent pacemakers. GENETICS \u2022 Seen in purebred pugs with hereditary stenosis of the bundle of His. \u2022 Seen in female miniature schnauzers predisposed to SSS. Is the most common arrhythmia in miniature schnauzers with SSS. \u2022 Congenitally deaf Dalmatian coach hounds often have abnormal SA node and multiple atrial arteries. May be a genetic component to the cause of SSS in those breeds predisposed (see Breed Predilections). INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Normal incidental finding in brachycephalic breeds of dogs in which inspiration causes a reflex increase in vagal tone. \u2022 Common in dog breeds predisposed to SSS. \u2022 Uncommon in cats. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Not applicable SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Brachycephalic breeds. \u2022 Breeds predisposed to SSS (e.g., miniature schnauzers, dachshunds, cocker spaniels, pugs, boxers and West Highland white terriers). Mean Age and Range If associated with SSS, generally middle-aged to older animals. Predominant Sex If associated with SSS, older females. SIGNS General Comments Generally no clinical significance by itself if terminated by sinus node depolarization, or latent pacemakers promptly escape to prevent ventricular asystole. Historical Findings \u2022 Usually none. \u2022 Signs of low cardiac output (e.g., weakness and syncope) may occur with failure of the SA node to fire on time if no lower pacemaker focus takes over the rhythm. \u2022 Sudden death is possible should prolonged periods of ventricular asystole occur. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May be normal. \u2022 Heart sounds following a pause may be louder because the ventricles have longer filling time and therefore eject a larger amount of blood. \u2022 Extremely slow heart rate if arrest or block is prolonged or frequent. \u2022 With significant pathologic cardiac disease\u2014may be findings consistent with poor cardiac output (e.g., prolonged perfusion time, pale mucous membranes, weak femoral pulses).

An irregular R-R interval is present that has more than 10% variation in sinus cycle length (or variability of 0.12 seconds [dog], 0.10 seconds [cat], or more exists between successive P waves) (Figure 1). \u2022 Two basic forms exist\u2014respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA): P-P interval cyclically shortens during inspiration due primarily to reflex inhibition of vagal tone and lengthens during expiration; nonrespiratory sinus arrhythmia: phasic variation in P-P interval unrelated to the respiratory cycle. ECG Features \u2022 Other than the irregular rhythm, all other criteria for sinus rhythm are present. \u2022 Normal heart rate. \u2022 Positive P wave in leads, I, II, III, and aVF, unless a wandering pacemaker is present, where the P waves may be positive, diphasic, or negative temporarily. \u2022 A P wave is present for every QRS complex. \u2022 A QRS complex is present for every P wave. \u2022 PR interval is relatively constant. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Sinus node discharge rate depends on the two opposing influences of the autonomic nervous system. Vagal stimulation decreases spontaneous sinus nodal discharge rate and predominates over sympathetic stimulation. Negative intrathoracic pressure occurring with inspiration causes decreased pressure on the vagus nerves. Feedback from the cardioregulatory and vasomotor centers in the medulla produces cardiac acceleration by decreasing vagal restraint on the sinus node; the opposite occurs during exhalation. The genesis of sinus arrhythmia also depends on reflexes involving pulmonary stretch receptors (Hering\u2013Breuer reflex), pressure\u2013volume sensory receptors in the heart (Bainbridge reflex whereby atrial stretch stimulates receptors in the atrial wall, causing vagal inhibition and increase in heart rate; baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch elicit inverse changes in heart rate with acute changes in arterial blood pressure), blood vessels, and chemical factors of the blood. \u2022 RSA is measured as a high-frequency component of heart rate variability (HRV) and is used as an index of cardiac vagal control. HRV measures beat to beat changes in heart rate and R-R variability from the ECG. HRV is a widely accepted clinical and research tool for evaluation of cardiac autonomic changes. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cardiovascular\u2014generally no hemodynamic consequence, but marked sinus arrhythmia may produce a long enough sinus pause to produce syncope if not accompanied by an escape rhythm.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Accelerated phase 4 diastolic depolarization of sinus nodal cells (as a result of voltage- and calcium-dependent mechanisms) generally responsible for sinus tachycardia (ST). \u2022 Enhanced adrenergic effect or cholinergic inhibition results in high rate of sinus impulse formation; changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cardiovascular\u2014cardiac output = heart rate \u00d7 stroke volume. Changes in heart rate affect preload, afterload, and contractility, which determine stroke volume; severe tachycardia can compromise cardiac output. Rapid rates shorten diastolic filling time, and particularly in diseased hearts, the increased heart rate can fail to compensate for decreased stroke volume, resulting in decreased cardiac output and coronary blood flow. Chronic tachycardias can cause cardiac dilation (tachycardiomyopathy) which often resolves with control of the tachycardia. However, ST is most often present due to elevated sympathetic tone and is physiologic (because of hypovolemia, fear, pain, etc.).

However, these criteria are now controversial. \u25e6 Antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD)\u2014used by several authors to describe patients that have diarrhea that responds to antibiotic therapy. Neither the type of bacteria nor the type of antibiotic that is effective has been defined for ARD. \u25e6 Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD)\u2014used by a group of clinicians in Finland to describe several dogs with chronic diarrhea that failed to respond to a variety of antibiotics or corticosteroids, but did respond to treatment with tylosin. \u2022 Currently, there is no consensus on the quantitative makeup of the gastrointestinal microbiota in healthy dogs or cats. \u2022 Note that SID differs from colonization of the alimentary tract by known pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni , enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens , enterotoxic Escherichia coli , or others). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Bacteria are constantly ingested with food and/or saliva. \u2022 Host-protective mechanisms prevent overgrowth of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria through gastric acid secretion, intestinal motility (peristalsis), secretion of antimicrobial substances in bile and pancreatic juice, and local enteric IgA production. \u2022 The ileocolic valve is a physiologic barrier between the large bowel, which is populated by large numbers of bacteria, and the less populated small bowel. \u2022 When these natural defense mechanisms fail and excessive numbers of certain bacterial species persist in the upper small intestine, they may cause pathology, even though they are not considered obligate pathogens. \u2022 Anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp.) have been considered more likely to cause pathology than many aerobic bacteria. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014normal absorptive function is disrupted, resulting in loose stool and weight loss. \u2022 Hepatobiliary\u2014portal vein carries bacterial toxins and other substances to the liver, which may lead to hepatic changes. GENETICS \u2022 No genetic basis for SID has been identified. However, recent studies would suggest that histiocytic ulcerative colitis should be considered a type of dysbiosis of the large intestine. Since the majority of cases have been described in the boxer, genetic factors that predispose dogs of this breed to this type of dysbiosis are likely. \u2022 Certain canine breeds (e.g., German shepherd dog, Chinese Shar-Pei, and beagle) appear to be at an increased risk for SID.

Physical Examination Findings Unremarkable or evidence of weight loss and decreased body condition. CAUSES \u2022 Primary SID is probably uncommon, but a definitive cause of SID often remains undiagnosed and thus many dogs are diagnosed with idiopathic SID. \u2022 Secondary SID (more common): \u25e6 Altered small intestinal anatomy\u2014inherited or acquired (e.g., congenital blind loop, partial obstructions, neoplasia, foreign body, intussusception, stricture, adhesion, or diverticulum). \u25e6 Altered intestinal motility\u2014 hypothyroidism, autonomic neuropathies. \u25e6 Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)\u2014 approximately 70% of dogs with EPI have concurrent SID. \u25e6 Hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria\u2014spontaneous or iatrogenic (e.g., proton pump inhibitor treatment). \u25e6 Altered immune system\u2014immunodeficiency, decreased mucosal defense, and preexisting intestinal disease.

Prevents irritating/ toxic material from entering these structures; often misinterpreted as vomiting by owners. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Irritation of submucosal irritant receptors; various stimuli (infectious, parasitic, irritant, mechanical\u2014especially accumulated secretions) will elicit these reflexes depending on where the irritation is applied. \u2022 Sneezing\u2014nasal mucosal irritation; improves with chronicity. \u2022 Reverse sneezing\u2014caudodorsal nasopharyngeal mucosal irritation triggers pharyngeal muscle spasms, subsequent laryngeal obstruction and movement of material into the oropharynx. \u2022 Gagging\u2014intraoral stimulation (tracheal, laryngeal, oropharyngeal, potentially esophageal mucosal irritation) detected by afferent limb of gag reflex. Efferent limb gives rise to uncoordinated muscle movement characteristic of gagging. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014frequently associated with infectious or inflammatory conditions involving the upper respiratory tract. \u2022 Gastrointestinal\u2014gagging may also be caused by swallowing, esophageal, or gastric disorders. GENETICS Not applicable INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE These are common, normal reflexes in both dogs and cats in response to mucosal irritation. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Worldwide SIGNALMENT \u2022 Any dog or cat may be affected. \u2022 These reflexes associated with the conditions that cause them; examples include: \u25e6 Young animals\u2014infection, congenital defects (cleft palate0, primary ciliary dyskinesia. \u25e6 Older animals\u2014nasal tumors, dental disease. \u2022 Acute sneezing in dogs is most often caused by a nasal foreign body, while in cats it is most often associated with acute viral rhinitis. SIGNS \u2022 Head and mouth position may help owners determine which of these reflexes are present. \u2022 Sneezing typically results in sudden, explosive expiratory effort(s) with the mouth closed and head thrown downward; may result in the animal\u2019s nose hitting the ground. \u2022 Reverse sneezing is a sudden, often paroxysmal, noisy, inspiratory effort with the head pulled back, mouth closed, and lips sucked in. \u2022 Gagging is an expiratory effort; typically, with the head and neck extended and mouth held open; usually ends with the animal swallowing (with little to nothing expelled). \u2022 Nasal discharge commonly seen with sneezing and reverse sneezing. Retching, coughing and vomiting may accompany gagging. CAUSES \u2022 Any mucosal irritation or inflammation can elicit these airway reflexes. The reflex localizes the site of irritation for further evaluation. \u2022 Nasal causes of sneezing and reverse sneezing include excess nasal secretions, rhinitis (idiopathic, secondary bacterial, viral or mycotic infections), foreign body, non-neoplastic masses (nasopharyngeal polyps, inflammatory polyps of the nasal turbinates), neoplasia, and parasites; dogs\u2014 Pneumonyssoides ; dogs and cats\u2014 Cuterebra , Eucoleus ( Capillaria ), Linguatula . \u2022 Extranasal diseases resulting in reverse sneezing, sneezing and gagging\u2014 pneumonia, esophageal strictures, megaesophagus, chronic vomiting, cricopharyngeal disorders, dental disease (oronasal fistulas, tooth root abscess). \u2022 Reverse sneezing may be idiopathic, especially in small-breed dogs with no other associated clinical signs. \u2022 Causes of gagging include: \u25e6 Secretions being coughed up from the lower airways and into the larynx or cervical trachea. \u25e6 Pharyngeal/laryngeal dysfunction resulting in airway aspiration due to loss of motor and/or sensory function that normally protects the airway. \u25e6 Vomiting from esophageal and gastrointestinal disease. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Brachycephalic and dolichocephalic breeds may be overrepresented. \u2022 Incompletely or unvaccinated animals are at a higher risk of developing infection. \u2022 Outdoor animals, especially hunting dogs, perhaps more at risk for nasal foreign bodies and nasal infections. \u2022 Chronic dental disease can cause rhinitis and either sneezing or reverse sneezing. \u2022 Environmental factors like dusty areas, smoke inhalation, perfumes, cold air. \u2022 Productive coughing may produce excess secretions that can be propelled into the nasopharynx and lead to reverse sneezing. \u2022 Nasal mites may cause both reverse sneezing and sneezing in dogs (but not cats); in the United States, incidence is inversely proportional to heartworm preventive usage. \u2022 Reverse sneezing is often associated with excitement.", "Soft Tissue Sarcoma": " \u2022 A mesenchymal neoplasm arising within or from connective tissues. \u2022 Tumors in this heterogeneous group have different histologic origins yet demonstrate similar pathologic features and clinical behavior, and include fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and myxosarcoma. Histology reports may commit only to soft tissue arcoma (STS) or spindle cell sarcoma, and may not distinguish among cell of origin without immunohistochemistry. \u2022 Because of divergent pathogenesis and biologic behavior, this group of tumors does not include hemangiosarcoma and other tumors that sometimes share the suffix (for example melanosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or lymphosarcoma). Histiocytic sarcoma is also considered separately. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Tumors can arise in connective tissues in any anatomic location. \u2022 Locally invasive behavior is typical with tumor extension beyond gross visible margins. \u2022 Tumors often have low (<20%, low grade/grades 1\u20132) to moderate (40\u201350%, high grade/grade 3) metastatic potential. \u2022 Tumors can develop at sites of chronic inflammation such as following ocular trauma or injection sites (cats). Also in vaccine\u00adinduced sarcomas in cats, the aluminum adjuvant may have inflammation\u00adindependent carcinogenic effects. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Skin\u2014most commonly arise from skin or subcutis. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014from muscle, fascial and fibrous tissues. \u2022 Nervous\u2014 originate from neurovascular structures. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014STS metastasize hematogenously, with predilection for pulmonary metastases development in advance disease stages. \u2022 Lymphatic\u2014regional lymph nodes are rare sites of metastasis. GENETICS There are no specific breed predilections that would suggest genetic predisposition. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 STS constitute 7% and 15% of skin and subcutaneous tumors in the cat and dog, respectively. \u2022 Incidence annually around 17 per 100,000 cats at risk; 35 per 100,000 dogs at risk.

SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Rate of growth often reflects grade (low grade = slow\u00adgrowing; high grade = rapid). \u2022 Typically nonpainful, fluctuant to firm mass. \u2022 Signs depend on location and local structures affected by tumor presence or invasion. \u2022 Tumors arising in the abdomen may elicit signs due to compression of the gastrointestinal tract and could include vomiting and/or diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Additionally signs of intestinal obstruction and occasionally perforation can occur with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma. \u2022 Urinary signs of hematuria and dysuria may be seen in young dogs with bladder rhabdomyosarcoma. \u2022 Peripheral nerve sheath tumors affecting the brachial or lumbosacral plexus can cause signs of lameness and pain, muscle atrophy, limb weakness progressing to paralysis. \u2022 Signs of hypoglycemia (paraneoplastic) such as weakness, collapse, and seizures can occur with leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Airway obstruction causes turbulence as air travels through a narrowed passage; with worsening obstruction or increasing airflow velocity, the amplification of airway sounds occur due to increased turbulence and vibration of tissue, secretions, or foreign bodies. \u2022 Obstruction sufficient to increase the work of breathing augments respiratory muscle effort and exacerbates turbulence; inflammation and edema of tissues in the region of the obstruction may develop, further reducing the airway lumen and further increasing the work of breathing, creating a vicious cycle. \u2022 Complete airway obstruction will result in the lack of sounds. \u2022 Obesity further increases respiratory effort and exacerbates airway obstruction. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Respiratory GENETICS \u2022 Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome is heritable in many breeds, including English and French bulldogs, pugs, Boston terriers, shih tzus, and other brachycephalic breeds. \u2022 Congenital laryngeal paralysis has been identified in bouvier des Flandres, bull terriers, Siberian huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and white-coated German shepherd dogs.

The use of the term \u201ccyst\u201d is misleading, as most do not have a defined cyst wall with an epithelial lining and the term subarachnoid diverticulum is frequently used when the lesion is spinal in location. This term is also problematic in cases in which arachnoid scarring simply causes dilation of the subarachnoid space. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 There are several proposed etiologies of subarachnoid cysts. \u2022 Any disease process that causes arachnoiditis has the potential to cause adhesions that result in the formation of one-way valves through which CSF flows, but cannot return, causing accumulation of CSF. \u2022 Congenital forms of the disease may result from abnormal splitting of the arachnoid membrane during development. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Nervous\u2014spinal cord and brain (quadrigeminal cistern). GENETICS Certain breeds appear to be predisposed (e.g., pug, Rottweiler for spinal cord, Pekingese, shih tzu for brain).

In a study of 122 cases, 19% of the dogs had pain. \u2022 There may be prior history of previous spinal cord injury (due to trauma, intervertebral disc disease, or fibrocartilagenous embolism). \u2022 There may be concurrent vertebral malformations at the site of the diverticula. Brain \u2022 Cerebellar signs. \u2022 Seizures. Physical Examination Findings Usually normal, although possible secondary consequences of the myelopathy include abrasions of the dorsal aspect of the toes, wearing of the nails, and urinary tract infections. Neurologic Examination Findings Spinal \u2022 Neurologic signs reflect lesion localization\u2014hindlimb involvement for thoracolumbar cysts and all limbs for cervical cysts. \u2022 Ataxia frequently characterized by hypermetria. \u2022 Paresis. \u2022 Proprioceptive placing deficits. \u2022 Fecal and/or urinary incontinence; urine retention (due to defective voiding). \u2022 Spinal reflexes may be reduced if the lesion is at the brachial or lumbosacral intumescence but otherwise are normal or increased. \u2022 Spinal pain is rarely elicited. Brain \u2022 Quadrigeminal cysts are frequently an incidental finding. However, extremely large cysts can produce compression of the cerebellum and brainstem. \u2022 Signs of cerebellar disease\u2014hypermetria, intention tremor, wide-based stance. \u2022 Signs of brainstem compression\u2014tetraparesis, head tilt. \u2022 Seizures (the relationship between the cyst and the presence of seizures is unclear). CAUSES \u2022 Several proposed etiologies. \u2022 Congenital malformation of the arachnoid mater (dilated septum posticum; in young dogs). \u2022 Secondary to traumatic injury to the arachnoid, causing adhesions and development of one-way valves for CSF flow. \u2022 Secondary to chronic microtrauma to the arachnoid, causing adhesions and development of one-way valves for CSF flow. This mechanism has been proposed for pugs with caudal thoracic subarachnoid cysts. Affected dogs may have hypoplasia of their articular facets leading to chronic instability. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Traumatic spinal cord injury that damages the arachnoid mater. \u2022 Hypoplastic articular facets associated with subarachnoid diverticulae in certain dog breeds (pugs).", "Subinvolution of Placental Sites": " \u2022 Failure or delay of normal postpartum uterine involution (normally requires 12\u201315 weeks to complete). \u2022 Failure of eosinophilic masses of collagen at placental sites to slough at 3\u20134 weeks post- partum. \u2022 Failure of fetal trophoblastic cells to regress (normally occurs within 2 weeks); instead, they invade the maternal deep glandular endometrium and myometrium. \u2022 Cause\u2014unknown; hormonal or uterine basis not suspected based on coexistence of unaffected and subinvoluted placental sites in the same uterus.

ECG Features (Figure 1) \u2022 Heart rate\u2014rapid, 180\u2013350 bpm in dogs. \u2022 Rhythm usually very regular (constant R-R interval) and may be sustained, but there can be frequent or infrequent short runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), so-called paroxysmal SVT. Rarely, the rhythm will be irregular, suggesting abnormal automaticity as the etiology. \u2022 Usually QRS complexes typical of normal sinus complexes, i.e., narrow with a normal mean electrical axis. In some cases a coexisting bundle branch block or aberrant ventricular conduction makes it difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate an SVT from a ventricular tachycardia by examining the ECG. \u2022 P waves can be normal or abnormal and typically differ in configuration from the sinus P waves. P waves may be buried in the previous T wave and therefore not visualized. \u2022 AV conduction is usually normal (1:1), but various levels of functional second-degree AV block may occur at higher atrial rates (2:1, 3:1, 4:1, etc.). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 SVT may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other cardiac diseases, generally those creating atrial enlargement. \u2022 May result from a reentrant mechanism or from abnormal automaticity in an ectopic focus. Reentrant SVT typically produces a very regular rhythm; SVT due to an automatic focus in atrial myocardium can produce an irregular rhythm. \u2022 Most cases in dogs respond to drugs that specifically alter conduction and refractoriness in the AV nodal tissue, suggesting AV nodal reentry as the mechanism. \u2022 Recent electrophysiologic studies revealed that some SVT in dogs is related to a congenital accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles, allowing electrical impulses to travel freely between the atria and ventricles without traversing the AV node and without conduction delay; in these cases, the SVT is caused by reentry through the accessory pathway and the AV node. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014congestive heart failure (CHF) may develop secondary to progressive myocardial failure associated with a chronically high heart rate (so-called tachycardia-induced myocardial failure). \u2022 Neuromuscular\u2014syncope or generalized episodic weakness due to reduced cardiac output and oxygen delivery. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and rarely cat. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Clinical signs may relate to the underlying cause. \u2022 Dogs with slow SVT or infrequent paroxysmal SVT may exhibit no clinical signs. \u2022 Dogs with fast SVT (heart rate usually >300 bpm) generally exhibit episodic weakness or syncope.

At diagnosis up to 32% of dogs have metastases with the most common sites being the local lymph node and lungs. \u2022 The disease is seen most commonly in the appendicular skeleton, specifically affecting the elbow, stifle, and shoulder joints. Synovial sarcoma must be differentiated via immunohistochemistry from other types of joint tumors, namely histiocytic sarcoma, which has a more aggressive biologic behavior and a worse prognosis.

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Unknown", "Syringomyelia and Chiari-Like Malformation": " \u2022 Chiari-like malformation (CM) is characterized by overcrowding of the cranio- cervical junction (CCJ) and obstruction of CSF channels (brachycephalic obstructive CSF channel syndrome [BOCCS]); may be associated with behavioral and clinical signs of pain (CM-P). \u2022 In syringomyelia (SM), fluid-filled cavities (syringes/syrinxes) develop within the spinal cord; it is a potential consequence of BOCCS. \u2022 Myelopathy can develop with wide SM and, if the dorsal horn is involved, phantom scratching and torticollis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY CM A complex disorder associated with brachy- cephaly involving skull base shortening, craniofacial hypoplasia, and CCJ abnormalities including increased proximity of the atlas to skull and increased odontoid angulation. There may a relative increase in parenchymal volume; for example, cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) have greater cerebellar volume compared to other breeds. The reduced cranial capacity results in rostrotentorial neuroparenchymal crowding with rostral forebrain flattening, small and ventrally orientated olfactory bulbs, displacement of the neural tissue to give increased height of the cranium and further reduction of the functional caudotentorial space with hindbrain herniation. CM is often compared to human chiari type I and 0 malformation, however it is more similar to complex craniosynostosis syndromes (premature fusion of multiple skull sutures). SM In addition to the above brachycephalic changes, dogs with SM are more likely to have CCJ abnormalities, including rostral displacement of the atlas with increased odontoid angulation, causing craniospinal junction deformation and medulla oblongata elevation. The most accepted theory of SM pathogenesis is that obstruction to CSF flow results in a mismatch in timing between the arterial and CSF pulse peak pressure. If peak CSF pressure is high when spinal arteriole and perivascular space pressures are low then the perivascular spaces act as a one-way valve, drawing in CSF which collects in, then expands and disrupts, the spinal cord central canal and ultimately a syrinx develops. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous. \u2022 Ophthalmic. GENETICS \u2022 CM has moderately high hereditability ( H 2 = 0.37). \u2022 Critically relevant SM-associated CM has high hereditability ( H 2 = 0.81). \u2022 Quantitative trait loci (QTL) study in the Brussels griffon identified two novel genomic regions associated to CM. One region contains a single gene, SALL-1 , involved in skull development. \u2022 Genome-wide linkage studies in CKCS identified a haplotype, inferring protection against SM associated with CM. \u2022 QTL in CKCS identified two loci on Canis familiaris autosome 22 (CFA 22) and CFA 26 associated with SM maximum transverse diameter linked to reduced volume of caudal cranial fossa: \u25e6 Loci on CFA22 contained a single gene, PCDH17 , a CNS cell adhesion molecule and strongest candidate gene. \u25e6 Loci on CFA26 contained a single gene, ZWINT , expression of which is associated with neuropathic pain. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 In some brachycephalic toy breeds, most notably the CKCS, prevalence of CM approaches 100%. \u2022 SM prevalence increases with age with 25% CKCS affected at 1 year, rising to 70% of CKCS >6 years. \u2022 Studies in the Brussels griffon suggest 42\u201352% have SM. \u2022 Prevalence of clinically relevant CMSM is difficult to determine as pain is subjective and difficult to measure directly. \u2022 One study suggested 15.4% prevalence of clinically relevant SM in 6-year-old CKCS.

RISK FACTORS Brachycephalicism and miniaturization.", "Systolic Anterior Motion": " Systolic anterior motion (SAM) is paradoxical dynamic movement of the mitral valve apparatus or some of its individual components in an anterior direction toward the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and interventricular septum during systole. When the chordae tendineae are the sole component of the valve apparatus displaced anteriorly, the term chordal anterior motion (CAM) is sometimes used. Pathophysiology \u2022 When SAM was first recognized it was believed to be specific to the setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) however, it has since been identified to occur under any circumstances that alter the dynamic geometry of the left ventricle (LV). \u2022 There are multiple factors that can contribute to the development of SAM which can broadly be broken down into three main groupings: structural abnormalities, altered ventricular kinetics, and altered ventricular geometry (see Causes). \u2022 Clinical manifestations occur on a spectrum of severity ranging from clinically silent changes to severe dynamic LVOT obstruction (LVOTO). \u2022 Significant LVOTO can result in a pressure overload on the LV, resulting in myocardial hypertrophy; if severe enough, myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmias may ensue. \u2022 Cardiac output is also reduced with severe LVOTO and may result in weakness or collapse. Systems Affected Cardiovascular Genetics Not applicable, but certain underlying conditions have a genetic basis in certain breeds (e.g., HCM, subvalvular aortic stenosis [SAS]). Incidence/Prevalence True prevalence is unknown. One study identified SAM in 5.8% of apparently normal cats, of which 91.1% had HCM. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Not applicable, but certain breeds may be predisposed to certain underlying conditions (e.g., SAS in Newfoundlands; HCM in Maine coons). Mean Age and Range Unknown SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Most animals are asymptomatic. \u2022 Signs are often attributable to underlying disease process. \u2022 Weakness, lethargy, or collapse may be observed with severe LVOTO. \u2022 Patients with advanced underlying cardiac disease may have signs of left-sided or right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) (e.g., tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, ascites). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Systolic murmur which may be static, intermittent, or labile, i.e., variable in intensity from moment to moment. \u2022 Diastolic gallop sounds may be present in patients with underlying cardiomyopathies. \u2022 Femoral pulse quality may be reduced in patients with severe LVOTO. \u2022 Arrhythmias may be appreciated (may be a direct sequela of severe LVOTO or may be due to the underlying disease process).

The essential developmental abnormality is probably cranial deviation of the infundibular (outlet) septum; the other defects are secondary. \u2022 Hemodynamics are determined primarily by the size of the VSD (typically large, i.e., equals or exceeds area of the open aortic valve) and the severity of RV outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO).

More selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) antagonists (e.g., meloxicam, deracoxib) have less effect on platelet function. \u2022 Thienopyridine prodrugs (e.g. clopidogrel) inhibit the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor. \u2022 Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions suppress platelet function in dogs in addition to other anticoagulant effects, but increased risk of bleeding is variable and prolonged with HES of higher molecular weight and higher molar substitution. \u2022 n 3 fatty acids have a mild thrombocytopathic effect in dogs that is not associated with clinical bleeding. \u2022 Penicillins, tetracyclines, potentiated sulfonamides, anesthetic/sedative agents, and antihistamines cause mild platelet function defects in humans. Adverse effects of carbenicillin and ticarcillin have been documented in dogs and have not been investigated in cats. Acquired\u2014Secondary to Systemic Disease Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), uremia, anemia, liver disease (cholestasis and acquired or inherited shunts), ehrlichiosis, leishmaniasis, heart disease, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and neoplastic disorders (both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic neoplasms) may alter platelet function. Hereditary \u2022 VWD (Doberman pinschers, German shorthair pointers, many other breeds)\u2014a deficiency (type I and III) or qualitative defect (type II) of von Willebrand factor (VWF) prevents platelet adhesion to areas of vascular injury. \u2022 CalDAG-GEFI hereditary thrombocytopathia (basset hound and Landseer dogs)\u2014mutations in signal transduction in platelets, preventing platelet activation. \u2022 Type I Glanzmann thrombasthenia (otterhound and great Pyrenees dogs)\u2014 platelet defect caused by a mutation in glycoprotein IIb\u2013IIIa (fibrinogen receptor) on the platelet surface. \u2022 Bernard Soulier syndrome (English cocker spaniel)\u2014mutation in glycoprotein IX (VWF receptor complex) on the platelet surface prevents platelet adhesion. \u2022 Chediak-Higashi syndrome, cyclic hematopoiesis, and dense granule defect (Persian cats, grey collie dogs, and American cocker spaniels, respectively)\u2014deficiency (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, cyclic hematopoiesis) or functional defect (dense granule defect) of delta-granules in platelets results in inability to activate additional platelets at site of vascular injury. \u2022 Scott syndrome (German shepherd dog)\u2014platelet procoagulant deficiency resulting in failure to externalize phospha- tidylserine, generate microparticles, and support effective assembly of coagulation complexes, caused by a TMEM16F mutation. \u2022 P2Y12 receptor mutation (greater Swiss mountain dog)\u2014multifactorial defect; platelets are not activated by ADP.", "Thrombocytopenia": " Platelet count below the reference interval, which varies by laboratory and methodology. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Platelets are produced by bone marrow megakaryocytes and released into the blood, where they normally circulate for 5\u201310 days. \u2022 Thrombocytopenia is caused by one or more of: decreased production, increased sequestration, utilization, or destruction of platelets. \u2022 Thrombocytopenia may result in spontaneous or excessive hemorrhage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Hemorrhage may occur into any organ system. Clinical hemorrhage is most commonly recognized in the skin (petechiae, ecchymoses) and from mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal, renal/urologic, and respiratory systems; less commonly recognized in the ophthalmic, nervous, and reproductive systems. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic abnormality. \u2022 Severe hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia is uncommon to rare. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs and cats. Breed Predilections Asymptomatic thrombocytopenias may be present in cavalier King Charles spaniels (see Pseudomacrothrombocytopenia [Inherited Macrothrombocytopenia]), greyhounds, Polish ogar dogs, Akitas. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Mild, moderate, and severe risk of spontaneous clinical hemorrhage at platelet counts of <25,000/ \u03bc L, <10,000/ \u03bc L, and <5,000/ \u03bc L, respectively. These figures are guidelines only because of variation in methods of platelet counting, imprecision of low platelet counts, and individual animal variation. \u2022 Concurrent platelet function defect, von Willebrand disease, coagulopathy, vasculitis, or sepsis increases risk of hemorrhage. Historical Findings \u2022 Spontaneous or excessive bleeding, generally from mucosal surfaces. \u2022 Lethargy and collapse. \u2022 Dyspnea and coughing (respiratory tract hemorrhage). \u2022 Neurologic signs. \u2022 Clinical signs of the primary disease.

Pathophysiology \u2022 Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and circulate for approximately 5\u20137 days. Approximately 30% of the circulating platelet mass resides transiently in the spleen and may be released suddenly with splenic contraction. \u2022 Platelet production is stimulated by thrombopoietin (TPO). \u2022 Thrombocytosis can be physiologic or reactive. Causes include physiologic redistribution, inflammation, and neoplasia. \u2022 In humans, specific gene mutations have been associated with the development of essential thrombocytosis. Systems Affected \u2022 Hematologic\u2014high circulating platelet count may impair ordinary hemostatic processes (especially von Willebrand factor\u00admediated platelet adhesion). \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014thrombosis or hemorrhage: uncommon. Incidence/Prevalence Reactive thrombocytosis is common in cats and dogs. SIGNALMENT Cats and dogs. SIGNS Historical and physical exam findings are related to underlying causes associated with the thrombocytosis or sequelae of micro or macrovascular thrombosis (e.g., organ failure, ischemic events) or hemorrhage. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Physiologic Thrombocytosis Occurs secondary to redistribution of platelets from the spleen into circulation, secondary to splenic contraction associated with stress, exercise, or excitement. Reactive Thrombocytosis Occurs secondary to other conditions and may be short\u00ad or longstanding. Platelet elevations are typically mild to moderate and do not generally pose a risk for thrombosis. Causes of reactive thrombocytosis include: \u2022 Inflammation secondary to infection, immune\u00admediated disease, surgery, trauma, or neoplasia. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin\u00ad6) stimulate TPO production, which stimulates platelet production. The most common inflammatory diseases resulting in thrombocytosis in dogs are immune\u00admediated, gastrointestinal, and hepatobiliary in nature. In cats, gastrointestinal illness (involving intestinal, hepatobiliary and/or pancreatic diseases) is the most common disease category associated with thrombocytosis. \u2022 Iron deficiency is a common but inconsistent cause of thrombocytosis. \u2022 Recovery from thrombocytopenia (rebound thrombocytosis). This occurs most commonly: \u26ac Post splenectomy (thrombocytosis may be marked and may persist for weeks). \u26ac Following withdrawal of myelosuppression. \u26ac During recovery from immune\u00admediated thrombocytopenia. \u26ac Following blood loss. \u2022 Hypercortisolemia secondary to hyperadrenocorticism or corticosteroid administration in dogs. In cats, hyperthyroidism may be a cause. \u2022 Nonhemic malignant neoplasia (paraneoplastic secondary to cytokines stimulating thrombopoiesis)\u2014carcinoma is the most common neoplasm associated with thrombocytosis. Drug-Induced \u2022 Epinephrine. \u2022 Vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine). Hemic Neoplasia/Myeloproliferative Disease \u2022 Chronic myeloproliferative diseases are uncommon and include essential thrombocythemia. \u2022 Acute megakaryocytic leukemia\u2014>30% of nucleated cells in bone marrow are megakaryoblasts; myelofibrosis may be present, and neoplastic megakaryoblasts may be present in circulation or other organs. \u2022 Markedly elevated platelet counts have been reported with essential thrombocythemia and acute megakaryocytic leukemia (1\u20135 \u00d7 10 6 platelets/ \u03bc L). Pseudothrombocytosis An artifactual increase in machine\u00adbased platelet count caused by red or white blood cell fragments and lipid particles associated with marked hyperchylomicronemia. A microscopic blood smear exam is required to properly identify this phenomenon.", "Thunderstorm and Noise Phobias": " Thunderstorm phobia is a disorder in which there is persistent and exaggerated fear of storms or the stimuli associated with storms. Fears of noises other than thunder also occur, such as fireworks or gunshots. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Pathophysiology involves physiologic, emotional, and behavioral components. Overactivation of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus is likely to be involved. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral\u2014avoidance or escape attempts, pacing, freezing, contact-seeking, vocalization. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014tachycardia. \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014increased cortisol levels, stress-induced hyperglycemia. \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI)\u2014inappetence, GI upset, hypersalivation. \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014self-induced trauma. \u2022 Nervous\u2014trembling, adrenergic/noradrenergic overstimulation. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014tachypnea. \u2022 Skin\u2014self-directed or accidental trauma, displacement grooming. GENETICS Familial patterns have been observed in dogs with noise phobias but the exact mechanisms of inheritance have not been established. PREVALENCE Fear responses to noises affect 23\u201350% of the canine population with storms, fireworks, vacuum cleaners and gunshots most commonly reported. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Occurs in dogs and cats but dogs more often presented for treatment. Cats with noise aversion might present with redirected aggression. \u2022 No association with sex or neuter status. \u2022 Any breed can be affected. In one study, thunderstorm phobias were most prevalent in herding breeds. \u2022 Dogs may begin exhibiting signs as puppies but may not be presented until adulthood. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 One or more of the following occurs during storms, or when exposed to the eliciting noise: panting, pacing, trembling, remaining near owner, hiding, salivating, destructiveness, vocalization, self-inflicted trauma, escape attempts and inappropriate elimination. \u2022 Stimuli that can elicit fear during storms include rain, lightning, thunder, wind, and possibly static electricity and changes in barometric pressure. Physical Examination Findings Unremarkable, except self-inflicted or escape-related injuries. CAUSES May include combinations of the following: \u2022 Lack of exposure to storms or noises early in development. \u2022 Highly aversive experience, such as exposure to a violent storm. \u2022 Genetic predisposition for emotional reactivity.", "Thymoma": " \u2022 Originates from thymic epithelium, rarely metastasizes. \u2022 Infiltrated with mature lymphocytes. \u2022 May be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (myasthenia gravis, hypercalcemia of malignancy). \u2022 Classified as invasive (malignant) or noninvasive (benign).

CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Not applicable", "Tick Bite Paralysis": " Flaccid, lower motor neuron tetraparesis to tetraplegia caused by salivary neurotoxins from certain species of female tick. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Presynaptic disorder\u2014tick injects salivary neurotoxin that interferes with the depolarization/acetylcholine release from the presynaptic nerve terminal of the neuromuscular junction; this effect is probably associated with an interruption of the calcium flux across axonal membranes. \u2022 Australian Ixodes holocyclus tick\u2014neurotoxin (holocyclotoxin) effects are more pronounced at higher temperatures; one adult tick is sufficient to cause neurologic signs, but infestation with I. holocyclus larvae or nymphs can also induce signs; holocyclotoxin also interferes with acetylcholine release at the autonomic nerve terminals. \u2022 Signs\u20145\u20139 days after initial tick attachment. \u2022 Not all infested animals develop tick paralysis; not all adult female ticks produce the toxin. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous\u2014peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junction most affected; cranial nerves can become involved, including the vagus and facial nerves with the North American ticks and, in addition, the trigeminal nerves and sympathetic nervous system with the Australian Ixodes tick. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014may see paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm; caudal brainstem respiratory center may be affected (rare with North American ticks; more common with Australian Ixodes ticks). GENETICS No genetic basis.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Environments that harbor ticks. \u2022 Australia\u2014higher risk during spring, and in areas with higher rainfall, containing tree cover and areas of water; higher risk of death if dog <6 months old or a toy breed.", "Ticks and Tick Control": " \u2022 Arachnids, arthropod ectoparasites feed on the blood of their hosts. \u2022 Most ticks are not host specific; divided into argasid (soft) and ixodid (hard) ticks. \u2022 Argasid are more primitive, more commonly parasitize birds; one of importance in dogs and cats is spinous ear tick ( Otobius megnini ). \u2022 Ixodid ticks are more specialized and highly parasitic, both sexes are bloodsuckers; Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor variabilis are common in dogs and cats. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Blood-loss anemia\u2014from heavy infestations. \u2022 Damage to the integument\u2014local irritation and infection may occur; tick adaptations suppress host response and allow feeding for up to 1 week. \u2022 Salivary secretions\u2014neurotoxins; other pharmacologically active compounds cause impaired hemostasis and immune suppression at the tick-feeding site. \u2022 Pathogens\u2014acquired when ticks feed on infected reservoir hosts (often rodents and small feral mammals); transmitted while feeding on dogs and cats. Tick Biology \u2022 Hard ticks\u2014four life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult; larvae and nymphs feed to repletion before detaching and molting; after detachment, females lay thousands of eggs and die; various tick stages may survive over winter, tolerate long starvation, low humidity, as well as water deprivation. Completion of life cycle requires three hosts; some species pass all stages on the same mammal. \u2022 Transovarial transmission\u2014organisms disseminate to the ticks\u2019 ovaries; infected eggs hatch and produce infected larvae. \u2022 Trans-stadial transmission\u2014immature ticks become infected while feeding on reservoir hosts and maintain infection through the molt from one life stage to the next, transmitting organisms to the new host when next stage feeds. \u2022 Ticks generally acquire hosts by a passive ambush process; when a suitable host brushes against vegetation harboring questing ticks, they transfer to the host. \u2022 Amblyomma americanum can be an active hunter and traverse distances of up to 18 m to attack a suitable host. \u2022 Symbiotic relationship\u2014 Ixodes scapularis infected with Anaplasma phagocytophylum express an antifreeze glycoprotein gene that enhances survival of the tick in cold weather. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Skin/exocrine. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune. \u2022 Musculoskeletal. \u2022 Nervous. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Strong geographic specificities exist for some tick species and their associated pathogens, producing geographic prevalence of associated diseases. \u2022 Ranges of ticks are expanding, therefore the geographic incidence of tick parasitism and infections vectored by them are expanding. \u2022 Emergence of new tick-borne infections and coinfection (due to coinfected vector ticks or parasitism of hosts by ticks of more than one species). \u2022 I. scapularis and I . pacificus \u2014midwest, northeast, southeast, and south-central United States and west coast, respectively. \u2022 R. sanguineus \u2014throughout the continental United States; R. sanguineus is unique among hard ticks; it can survive and establish its life cycle inside dwellings and kennels at (low) household humidity (common name \u201ckennel tick\u201d). \u2022 D. variabilis \u2014eastern seaboard and west coast of United States. \u2022 A. americanum \u2014found throughout the midwest, south-central, southeast, and parts of the northeast United States with strong range expansion. \u2022 Amblyomma maculatum \u2014gulf coast states of United States with range expansion. SIGNALMENT Species \u2022 Dog and cat. \u2022 Cats are efficient at removing ticks; tick attachment and tick-vectored diseases including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and cytauxzoonosis have been diagnosed in domestic felines. SIGNS \u2022 Attached ticks or tick-feeding cavities may be seen on the skin. \u2022 Irritation secondary to bite. \u2022 Petechia secondary to infectious organisms ( Rickettsia , Anaplasma platys ). \u2022 Blood-loss anemia (direct effect); thrombocytopenia, anemia, inclusion bodies in neutrophils, monocytes, red blood cells secondary to transmitted infectious organisms. \u2022 Limb/joint abnormalities secondary to infectious organisms ( Borrelia burgdorferi and other organisms implicated in oligo- and polyarthritis). \u2022 Cardiac\u2014Lyme carditis ( B . burgdorferi ), manifests typically as atrioventricular block; rare and poorly documented in dogs. \u2022 Renal\u2014unique, generally fatal proteinlosing nephropathy in dogs infected with B. burgdorferi linked to immune complexes associated with antigen and antibody from infection. \u2022 Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever\u2014vague or non-specific symptoms of fever, lethargy, joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, focal hemorrhages (Rickettsia rickettsii). \u2022 Paralysis\u2014neurotoxins secreted from tick salivary glands produce ascending weakness and paralysis. \u2022 Pyogranulomatous myositis, periosteal reaction, neutrophilia, antigenic stimulation, and amyloid deposition in viscera in Hepatozoon americanum infection in which the dog serves as the intermediate and reservoir host following tick ingestion. \u2022 Weight loss, anemia, lethargy, fever, neutrophilia, hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia in Hepatozoon canis infection. Infection occurs by digesting the tick ( A. americanum ), which is the definitive host. CAUSES Ticks\u2014attracted to hosts by warmth, presence of carbon dioxide, physical contact, and host-associated odors. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Domestic animals\u2014can be in close contact with ticks due to invasion of ticks into suburban environments and expansion of suburban environment into surrounding forests, prairies, and coastline areas. \u2022 Travel\u2014increases risk for exposure. \u2022 Risk is expanding as new cycles for maintenance of infectious organisms are emerging (and being discovered).", "Toad Venom Toxicosis": " \u2022 Two species of primary concern in North America\u2014Colorado River toad ( Incilius alvarius ) and marine/cane toad ( Rhinella marina ); marine toad more toxic; both can be fatal. \u2022 I. alvarius found in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado; R. marina found in Florida, Texas, and Hawaii. Both species have body lengths up to 23 cm; easily distinguishes them from other toad species.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Hypocellular tracheal cartilage in the cervical region identified historically in some smallbreed dogs. \u2022 Lack of chondroitin sulfate and/ or decreased glycoproteins within the cartilage matrix results in a reduction in bound water and loss of rigidity in the cartilage. \u2022 Causes of bronchomalacia not established\u2014cartilage abnormalities could include a mechanism similar to cervical tracheal collapse, defects in chondrogenesis, nutritional deficiencies, or degenerative changes caused by chronic airway disease. \u2022 Collapse\u2014weak tracheal cartilage allows flattening of the normal ring structure; trachea collapses in a dorsoventral direction when pressure fluctuates within the airway lumen. During inspiration, intrapleural pressure becomes more negative leading to a drop in intra-airway pressure. Atmospheric pressure exceeds airway pressure in the cervical region and lack of cartilage support results in cervical collapse. During forced expiration, intrapleural pressure becomes positive and exceeds intrathoracic intra-airway pressure. When cartilaginous airway walls are weakened by bronchomalacia, intrathoracic airway collapse occurs, on expiration. \u2022 Increased tension on the trachealis dorsalis muscle or neurogenic atrophy of the muscle causes stretching of the dorsal tracheal membrane with protrusion into the airway lumen. \u2022 Coughing\u2014mechanical trauma to the tracheal mucosa from collapse of the dorsal tracheal membrane exacerbates airway edema and inflammation. \u2022 Upper airway obstruction worsens clinical signs, and chronic increases in respiratory effort could lead to secondary abnormalities in laryngeal structure and function. \u2022 Small airway disease augments the trans-airway pressure gradient and potentiates collapse in the intrathoracic region.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 May be within the range of normal dog behaviors. \u2022 Insufficient outlets for normal activities may contribute. \u2022 Jumping up may be associated with excessive greeting but can be associated with separation anxiety or social anxiety. \u2022 Pulling can be associated with different motivational states including but not limited to fear, anxiety, excitement, and predatory behavior. \u2022 Pathologic hyperactivity and anxiety disorders may rarely be a contributing factor. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Behavioral. \u2022 Gastrointestinal. SIGNALMENT Species Dogs Breed Predilection Herding and hunting breeds may be more likely to chase. Mean Age and Range More common in younger dogs but occurs at any age. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Jumping up on people occurs more commonly in association with arrivals, departures, or other greetings; also associated with exploring countertops or tables. \u2022 Pulling may be more likely in the beginning of a walk or when seeing, hearing, or perhaps smelling a stimulus (e.g., person, other dog, object of interest) but can occur at any point. \u2022 Items displaced, damaged, chewed, or ingested are common complaints in stealing. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Usually unremarkable unless underlying medical problems. \u2022 Nails worn down. CAUSES \u2022 Jumping up is normal greeting and play behavior. Excitement, encouragement of the behavior, or inadvertent rewarding perpetuates it. Separation anxiety may result in excessive jumping on owners when returning home or leaving. Social anxiety may cause overly exuberant greeting of visitors, with jumping. \u2022 Pulling can occur when a dog is not taught how to walk on loose leash or due to different motivational states. A dog may pull toward or away from something it is afraid of (avoidance) or toward something that is fear-evoking (aggression) or that it is excited about greeting. \u2022 Stealing is a normal acquisitive behavior. It can be an attention-seeking behavior or motivated by the appeal of the odor, texture, or taste of an item with which to chew, eat, or play. Stealing can occasionally be comfort-seeking or related to separation anxiety, in which the dog may steal an item when anxious as the owner is preparing to leave or when the dog is separated from the owner but the owner is still in the house. \u2022 Chasing is a normal behavior, as part of herding, hunting, play, and defense.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY This is a disorder of the emptying phase of micturition due to functional obstruction of the outflow tract and urethra. While the pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is thought that the neurologic lesion is located within the reticulospinal tract, Onuf nucleus, or caudal mesenteric ganglion. The loss of inhibitory signals to the pudendal and hypogastric nerves may also be involved.

Humans are accidental hosts; because of the aquatic portion of its life cycle, water is an essential element of the habitat of D. renale . Minks are the most commonly infected mustelids, and are the principal definitive host in North America. Life Cycle \u2022 To complete the life cycle, both males and females must be located in the same kidney of the host, and the urinary tract must be the patent. Fertile eggs are passed with urine voided by the host, and then embryonate in water. First-stage larvae are produced after 1\u20137 months. The definitive hosts become infected by ingesting the infective larvae in annelids. \u2022 Definitive hosts are infected by ingesting raw fish, frogs, other paratenic hosts, or Lumbriculus variegatus . After ingestion, the infected larvae penetrate the walls of the stomach or intestines and migrate to the submucosa. After approximately 5\u20137 days, they migrate to the liver and remain there for about 50 days. Migration to the right or the left kidney and invasion of the renal pelvis follows. \u2022 D. renale have been found more frequently in the right kidney than in the left. Finding encysted D. renale around liver is associated with larval penetration at the lesser curvature of the stomach. On occasion, D. renale have been encountered in the urinary bladder and/ or ureters. Infective larvae become mature gravid females in the definitive host after 3.5\u20136 months. The entire life cycle requires approximately 2 years. Pathophysiology in the Kidney \u2022 Adult parasites have attained substantial size by the time they penetrate the kidney. The exact mechanisms involved with gaining access to the renal pelvis is unknown, but probably results from the effects of enzymes released by the parasite. \u2022 Available evidence does not support the theory that adult D. renale slowly devour the renal tissue of the host, reducing it to a hollow sack. Although the exact mechanism(s) of destruction is not known, obstruction caused by the growing adult parasite(s) and secondary hydronephrosis (or pyonephrosis) plays a major role. Examination of the kidneys from dogs with unilateral renal infection reveals changes typical of advanced hydronephrosis (i.e., obliteration of the majority of renal tubules surrounded by chronic inflammatory tissue and persistence of the structural architecture of many glomeruli). \u2022 Ova of D. renale may be observed in the renal parenchyma adjacent to the renal pelvis. The urothelium lining the renal pelvis is often hyperplastic. \u2022 If only one kidney is affected with D. renale the host retains adequate renal function due to compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the remaining kidney. If both kidneys are parasitized, or if one kidney is parasitized and the opposite kidney has substantial comorbid dysfunction, varying stages of renal failure and uremia may occur. Eggs that are released by female worms pass through the urinary tract and provoke inflammation in the mucosa of the ureter and urinary bladder. Pathophysiology in the Peritoneal Cavity \u2022 In dogs, viable parasites located in the abdominal cavity and/or between lobes of the liver have been incidental findings during ovariohysterectomy. \u2022 Eggs present in the peritoneal cavity can trigger development of chronic peritonitis. Examination of the abdominal viscera from dogs with D. renale in the peritoneal cavity revealed hemorrhage, granulomatous inflammation, and fibrosis frequently involving the omentum, the surface of the liver, and the surface of the spleen. Viable adult males have been found in the peritoneal cavity of dogs without an associated inflammatory response. \u2022 Ascites may occur in dogs with peritoneal D. renale colonization. The fluid detected in the abdominal cavity is usually hemorrhagic. Pearsonema (Capillaria) \u2022 Pearsonema and Capillaria are used interchangeably and appear to be identical in taxonomy and biologic behavior. \u2022 Pearsonema (Capillaria) plica are small, thread-like, yellowish parasites that invade the mucosa or submucosa of the bladder and rarely the renal pelvis and ureter, causing a mild inflammatory response. \u2022 P. plica in dogs and cats and P. feliscati in cats have been uncommonly associated with signs of lower urinary tract disease. \u2022 P. plica passes ova with bipolar plugs in urine. When earthworms ingest embryonated ova, the parasite develops into the infective stage. Ingestion of an infective earthworm results in a patent infection in dogs in 58\u201388 days. \u2022 The life cycle of P. feliscati is poorly understood. SIGNALMENT D. renale \u2022 Dogs and cats. Pearsonema \u2022 Dogs\u2014no predilection reported. \u2022 Cats\u2014affected cats almost always > 8 months old. SIGNS D. renale \u2022 Feeding L. variegatus infected with D. renale to dogs typically induces vomiting due to effects of the parasite on the gastric mucosa. \u2022 If only one kidney has been invaded with D. renale , signs are often absent. \u2022 Silent hematuria may be the first indication of an abnormality. \u2022 Palpation of the abdomen may reveal an enlarged and/or misshapen hydronephrotic kidney. \u2022 If both kidneys are parasitized, clinical signs attributable to renal failure or uremia may occur. The host will typically die before extensive hydronephrosis of both kidneys has time to develop. The degree of renal dysfunction is influenced by (1) number of parasites in the kidney, (2) duration of infection, (3) number of kidneys parasitized, and (4) presence and severity of comorbid renal disease. Pearsonema \u2022 Usually none. \u2022 Pollakiuria, hematuria, stranguria, and dysuria in heavily infected animals. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS D. renale See Overview. Pearsonema Dogs \u2022 High prevalence of infection (up to 50%) in the natural hosts (e.g., foxes, raccoons) in the southeastern United States may predispose animals in this geographic region. \u2022 In kennels, high infection rates associated with contaminated soil surfaces. Cats Rare in United States; infection prevalence of 18\u201334% is reported in Australia.", "Urolithiasis, Calcium Oxalate": " Formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths within the urinary tract and associated clinical conditions (e.g., urinary obstruction, idio - pathic hypercalcemia, chronic kidney disease). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Presence of hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and defective crystal growth inhibitors. Hypercalciuria In dogs, normocalcemic hypercalciuria may result from intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium (so-called absorptive hypercalciuria: type 1\u2014dietary independent, type 2\u2014dietary dependent, and type 3\u2014phosphaturic induced hypervitaminosis D) or reduced renal tubular reabsorption of calcium (renal leak hypercalciuria). Hypercalcemic hyper - calciuria results from excessive glomerular filtration of mobilized calcium, which overwhelms normal renal tubular reabsorptive mechanisms (called resorptive hypercalciuria, since bone resorption is associated with high serum calcium concentrations). Hyperoxaluria In humans, hyperoxaluria is associated with inherited abnormalities of excessive oxalate synthesis (primary hyperoxaluria types I, II, and III), excess consumption of foods containing high quantities of oxalate or oxalate precursors, pyridoxine deficiency, and disorders associated with fat malabsorption (i.e., fat complexes with intestinal calcium augmenting intestinal absorption of oxalate). Lack of oxalate-degrading bacteria in the intestine can increase the quantity of oxalate absorbed from the diet and the quantity excreted in urine. Hypocitraturia Urine citrate inhibits CaOx urolith formation. By complexing with calcium ions to form the relatively soluble salt calcium citrate, citrate reduces the quantity of calcium available to bind with oxalate. In normal dogs, acidosis is associated with low urinary citrate excretion, whereas alkalosis promotes urinary citrate excretion. Defective Crystal Growth Inhibitors Large-molecular-weight proteins in urine, such as Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein, nephrocalcin, and osteopontin, have a profound ability to enhance solubility of CaOx. Urine from dogs with CaOx uroliths revealed that nephrocalcin had fewer carboxyglutamic acid residues than nephro - calcin isolated from normal dog urine. Feeding Diets Promoting Urine Acidification Diets designed to promote aciduria are a common risk factor in cats and dogs. In several species, acidic urine is associated with hypercalciuria (bone mobilization of calcium, increased glomerular filtration of calcium, and decreased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium) and hypocitraturia (increased renal tubular reabsorption). SYSTEMS AFFECTED Renal/urologic INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE In dogs, CaOx accounts for approximately 40% of the uroliths removed from the lower urinary tract and 45% of those removed from the upper urinary tract. In cats, CaOx accounts for approximately 40% of the uroliths removed from the lower urinary tract and 90% of those retrieved from the upper urinary tract. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections \u2022 Dogs\u2014reported in many breeds. Six breeds represent 60% of cases: miniature schnauzer, Lhasa apso, Yorkshire terrier, bichon fris\u00e9, shih tzu, and miniature poodle. \u2022 Cats\u2014Himalayan, Scottish fold, Persian, ragdoll, and Burmese are at greater risk.

SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Asymptomatic in some animals. \u2022 Depend on location, size, and number of uroliths. \u2022 Animals with nephroliths are typically asymptomatic but may have persistent hematuria. \u2022 Ureteral obstruction associated with contralateral microrenale, ipsilateral hydronephrosis, and acute onset of uremia occurs frequently in cats with chronic kidney disease. Historical Findings \u2022 Typical signs of urocystoliths or urethroliths include pollakiuria, dysuria, and hematuria. Some may present for urethral obstruction. \u2022 Nephroureteroliths common (45%) in cats with chronic kidney disease. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Detection of urocystoliths are by abdominal or urethral palpation; failure to palpate uroliths does not exclude them from consideration. \u2022 Large urinary bladder with complete urethral obstruction (more common in cats). \u2022 Urocystoliths with irregular contours rarely cause complete urethral obstruction. CAUSES See Pathophysiology. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Oral calcium supplements given independent of meals. \u2022 Feeding acidifying foods that promote formation of aciduria (pH <6.6 in dogs and <6.25 in cats) was associated with CaOx urolithiasis. In normal cats, alkaline urine was associated with the lowest saturation for CaOx. \u2022 Aciduria was a risk factor for first-time CaOx urolith formation in dogs. \u2022 In healthy cats, urinary undersaturation for CaOx was achieved by inducing alkaluria via dietary formulation with potassium citrate. \u2022 Excessive dietary protein, sodium (>1.2% DMB or 350 mg/100 kcal) and vitamin D promote hypercalciuria. \u2022 Additional dietary oxalate (e.g., chocolate and peanuts) and ascorbic acid promote hyperoxaluria. \u2022 Glucocorticoids and furosemide promote hypercalciuria. \u2022 Vitamin B6-deficient diets (e.g., homemade) promote hyperoxaluria. \u2022 Consumption of dry diets has a higher risk for CaOx urolith formation than consumption of high-moisture canned diets.", "Urolithiasis, Calcium Phosphate": " \u2022 Calcium phosphate (CP) uroliths within the urinary tract and associated clinical conditions. \u2022 Forms of CP identified in dogs and cats include: calcium phosphate apatite (CAP), calcium phosphate carbonate (CPC), calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (brushite), and uncommon minerals\u2014 tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite) and octacalcium phosphate. \u2022 CP uroliths represent a small fraction (dogs <1.0%, cats <0.5%) of all uroliths submitted to the Minnesota Urolith Center (MUC) from 1981 to 2018 (Table 1). \u2022 More CP uroliths are found in the upper tract (kidney and ureter) (2.5% cats, 3.5% dogs), than in the lower tract (bladder and urethra). \u2022 CP uroliths (excluding brushite) do not have a characteristic shape.

SIGNS \u2022 Depend on location, size, and number of uroliths. \u2022 Pollakiuria, dysuria, hematuria, and urethral obstruction.  \u2022  Nephroureteroliths\u2014 typically asymptomatic but may have persistent hematuria or signs referable to concomitant renal failure (primarily cats). CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 CPC\u2014commonly a minor component of struvite and calcium oxalate uroliths. \u2022 Pure CP uroliths\u2014usually associated with metabolic disorders, e.g., primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, and excessive dietary calcium and phosphorus. \u2022 Urinary tract infections\u2014increased calcium excretion in combination with urinary tract infection with urease producing bacteria may be risk factors favoring CPC. \u2022 Nephroliths, urocystoliths, and urethroliths composed of blood clots mineralized with CP suggest dystrophic mineralization of tissue, in contrast to metastatic mineralization reflecting abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism. \u2022 Other risk factors\u2014see Urolithiasis, Calcium Oxalate.", "Urolithiasis, Cystine": " \u2022 Formation of uroliths composed of cystine. \u2022 Cystinuria\u2014an inborn error of metabolism caused by defective tubular reabsorption of cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine (COLA) leading to cystine urolith formation. \u2022 Cystine is freely filtered by glomeruli; however, most is actively reabsorbed in the renal proximal tubules. \u2022 Impaired intestinal absorption of these amino acids has not been associated with any nutritional deficiency states in dogs, presumably because these are non-essential amino acids. However, cystine may be semi-essential amino acid and as a precursor of taurine, excessive cystine loss may affect taurine availability. \u2022 Unless protein intake is severely restricted, cystinuric dogs have no detectable abnormalities associated with amino acid loss. Excessive loss of arginine in urine predisposes cats to hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Some cystinuric dogs may have carnitinuria. \u2022 Cystinuric dogs have been classified into three different types: type 1 autosomal recessive SLC3A1 mutations found in Newfoundlands, Landseer, and Labrador retrievers; type 2 autosomal dominant SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 identified in Australian cattle dogs and European miniature pinschers, and type 3, which has sex-limited inheritance (androgen dependence) and has been identified in mastiffs, English and French bulldogs, Scottish deerhounds, and Irish terrriers. \u2022 Not all cystinuric dogs and cats form uroliths; cystinuria is a predisposing rather than a primary cause of cystine urolithiasis. Cystine is relatively insoluble in acid urine and is more soluble in alkaline urine. \u2022 This disease is genetically heterogeneous ( SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 ) in cats as it is in dogs and humans. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs\u2014primarily adult (mean age 5 years; range 3 months\u201314 years) intact males, but may also affect females. It occurs in excess of 100 breeds, including dachshunds, English bulldogs, Newfoundlands, Labrador retrievers, Chihuahuas, pit bulls, and French bulldogs. May be detected in male and female Newfoundland and Labradors <1 year of age. \u2022 Cats\u2014primarily adult (mean age at diagnosis, 3.5 years; range, 4 months\u201312 years) males and females; most common in the domestic shorthair and Siamese breeds. SIGNS \u2022 Depend on location, size, and number of uroliths; affected animals may be asymptomatic. \u2022 Urocystoliths\u2014include pollakiuria, dysuria, and hematuria. \u2022 Urethroliths\u2014include urethral obstruction, pollakiuria, dysuria, and sometimes voiding of small smooth uroliths. Complete outflow obstruction may result in postrenal azotemia that may progress to uremia. \u2022 Nephroliths\u2014typically asymptomatic; may be associated with manifestations of hydro - nephrosis and renal insufficiency. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Inherited defects in renal tubular transporters of cystine. \u2022 Breed predisposition. \u2022 In young and middle-aged dogs with previous history of cystine urolithiasis\u2014 recurrence within 6\u201312 months following surgery unless prophylactic therapy is given. \u2022 Urolith formation\u2014enhanced by acidic, concentrated urine, incomplete and infrequent micturition.", "Urolithiasis, Pseudo (Dried Blood, Ossified Material)": " Pseudo-uroliths are concretions of noncrystalline material that form within the urinary tract. They include dried solidified blood and ectopic bone. Pseudo-uroliths can be located in upper or lower sections of the urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra). SIGNALMENT Pseudo-uroliths are primarily a disease of cats. \u2022 Dried solidified blood pseudo-uroliths comprise 1% or less of feline uroliths. They are 2\u20133 times more common in male than female cats. The mean age of affected cats is 9 years old (range 1\u201315 years). \u2022 Ectopic bone pseudo-uroliths are rare, with few cases reported. SIGNS \u2022 Urinary tract obstructions (ureteral or urethral) are common. Obstructions can result in uremia with anorexia, vomiting, weakness, and, if hyperkalemia is present, bradycardia. Urethral obstructions can also cause nonproductive stranguria and a palpably enlarged, firm bladder. \u2022 Other signs include hematuria, dysuria, and pollakiuria. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Dried solidified blood pseudo-uroliths are associated with hematuria, but mechanisms underlying their formation are unknown. Concurrent urinary tract infections are occasionally present. \u2022 Ectopic bone forms due to ossification of the urothelium. Trauma and inflammation are risk factors in humans, but their role in veterinary species has not been determined.", "Urolithiasis, Struvite\u2014Cats": " Struvite uroliths and urethral plugs have physical and etiopathogenic differences; these terms should not be used as synonyms. Struvite uroliths are polycrystalline concretions composed primarily of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and small quantities of matrix. Struvite urethral plugs are composed of large quantities of matrix mixed with crystals (especially MAP), while others are composed primarily of organic matrix, sloughed tissue, blood, and/or inflammatory reactants. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 See Urolithiasis, Struvite\u2014Dogs. \u2022 Most urethral plugs contain large quantities of matrix in addition to minerals, especially struvite. Risk factors associated with formation of MAP crystals contained in urethral plugs are similar to those associated with formation of struvite uroliths. Prevention or control of these risk factors should minimize the recurrence of the struvite component of urethral plugs. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Renal/urologic\u2014upper and lower urinary tract. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 From 1981 to 2002, the prevalence of struvite uroliths has decreased and while that of calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths has increased. In 2015, struvite comprised 49% and CaOx comprised 36% of feline uroliths. \u2022 Currently, struvite makes up ~50% of all types of uroliths in the lower urinary tract. Of these, 95% are sterile. \u2022 Struvite has been detected in approximately 8% of feline nephroliths. \u2022 Struvite has remained the most common ( ~ 90%) mineral in matrix-crystalline urethral plugs. SIGNALMENT Species Cat (see Urolithiasis, Struvite\u2014Dogs). Mean Age and Range \u2022 Mean age at time of diagnosis is 7 years (range, <1\u201322 years). \u2022 Sterile struvite uroliths do not affect immature cats; infection-induced struvite may occur in immature (<1 year) and senior cats (>10 years). Predominant Sex \u2022 Struvite uroliths are more common in female cats (55%) than in males. \u2022 Struvite urethral plugs primarily affect males. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Affected cats may be asymptomatic. \u2022 Depend on location, size, number, and cause of uroliths. Historical Findings \u2022 Typical signs of urocystoliths include pollakiuria, dysuria, periuria, hematuria, and sometimes voiding of small, smooth uroliths. \u2022 Signs of renal dysfunction (polyuria and polydipsia) are found in some cats with nephroliths. \u2022 Signs of outflow obstruction (e.g., dysuria, large painful urinary bladder, and postrenal azotemia) are found with struvite urethral plugs. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 A thickened, firm, contracted bladder wall may be appreciated. \u2022 Palpation is insensitive and unreliable for detection of urocystoliths. \u2022 Urethral plugs or urethroliths may be detected by examination of the distal penis. \u2022 Outflow obstruction results in an enlarged urinary bladder and signs of postrenal azotemia. CAUSES See Pathophysiology. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Sterile struvite uroliths\u2014mineral composition, energy content, and moisture content of diets; urine-alkalinizing metabolites in diets; quantity of diet consumed; ad libitum vs. meal-feeding schedules; formation of concentrated urine; and retention of urine. \u2022 Infection-induced struvite urolithiasis\u2014urinary tract infection (UTI) with urease-producing bacteria, abnormalities in local host defenses that allow bacterial UTIs, and the quantity of urea excreted in urine. \u2022 The small diameter of the male distal urethra predisposes to obstruction with plugs and urethroliths.", "Urolithiasis, Struvite\u2014Dogs": " Formation of polycrystalline concretions (i.e., uroliths, calculi, or stones) composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MAP, struvite) in the urinary tract. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Infection-Induced Struvite \u2022 Urine must be supersaturated with MAP for struvite uroliths to form. MAP supersaturation of urine is often associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) with urease-producing microbes. \u2022 UTIs caused by urease-producing microbes ( Staphylococcus , Proteus , and Ureaplasma ) and urine containing sufficient urea favors formation of uroliths containing struvite, carbonate apatite, and calcium apatite. \u2022 Consumption of dietary protein exceeding the daily requirement results in formation of urea from catabolism of amino acids. \u2022 Metabolic and anatomic abnormalities may indirectly induce struvite uroliths by predisposing to UTIs. Sterile Struvite \u2022 In dogs, this type of struvite is uncommon. \u2022 Dietary or metabolic factors may be involved in the genesis of sterile struvite uroliths in dogs. \u2022 Microbial urease is not involved in formation of sterile struvite uroliths. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Renal/urologic. GENETICS \u2022 The high incidence of struvite uroliths in some breeds such as miniature schnauzers suggests a familial tendency. Susceptible miniature schnauzers may inherit an abnormality of local host defenses of the urinary tract that increases their susceptibility to UTI. \u2022 Sterile struvite uroliths were found in a family of English cocker spaniels. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Struvite uroliths account for approximately 40% of stones affecting the canine lower urinary tract and 23% of stones affecting the upper urinary tract. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Ubiquitous SIGNALMENT Species Dog Breed Predilections \u2022 Miniature schnauzer, shih tzu, bichon frise, miniature poodle, cocker spaniel, and Lhasa apso. \u2022 Any breed may be affected. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Mean age, 6 years (range <1 to >19 years). \u2022 Most uroliths in immature (<12 months old) dogs are infection-induced struvite. Predominant Sex More common in females ( ~ 85%) than males ( ~ 15%), which may be related to the greater propensity for females to develop bacterial UTI. SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Some dogs are asymptomatic. \u2022 Signs depend on location, size, and number of uroliths and virulence of bacteria. Historical Findings \u2022 Typical signs of urocystoliths include pollakiuria, dysuria, and hematuria; sometimes small, smooth uroliths are voided. \u2022 Typical signs of urethroliths include pollakiuria and dysuria; sometimes small, smooth uroliths are voided, and some medium size uroliths are associated with urethral obstruction. \u2022 Nephroliths may be associated with manifestations of renal insufficiency. Obstruction to urine outflow with bacterial UTI may result in generalized pyelonephritis and septicemia. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Uroliths may be palpated in the urinary bladder and urethra (by rectal exam). \u2022 Urethral obstruction may cause enlargement of the urinary bladder. \u2022 Ureteral obstruction may cause enlargement and pain of the associated kidney. \u2022 Complete urine outflow obstruction combined with bacterial infection may cause ascending UTI and signs of renal failure and septicemia. CAUSES \u2022 Urinary tract disorders that predispose to infections with urease-producing bacteria, fungal pathogens, or ureaplasma in patients whose urine contains a large quantity of urea. \u2022 Specific causes of sterile struvite uroliths are unknown. RISK FACTORS \u2022 Exogenous or endogenous exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids predispose to bacteriuria. \u2022 Abnormal retention of urine. \u2022 Alkaline urine decreases the solubility of struvite.", "Urolithiasis, Urate": " Uroliths composed of uric acid, sodium urate, or ammonium urate. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Impaired conversion of uric acid to allantoin (see Figure 1) causes high concentration of uric acid in serum and urine. \u2022  Patients with portosystemic shunts may develop ammonium urate uroliths because of impaired hepatic metabolism of uric acid and ammonia. GENETICS Dalmatians have a breed predisposition to forming urate urolithiasis. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Approximately 5\u20138% of uroliths retrieved from dogs and cats. SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat.

Naturally occurring or drug-induced impairment of xanthine oxidase results in hyperxanthinemia and xanthinuria. \u2022 Naturally occurring xanthinuria is likely caused by a familial or congenital defect in xanthine oxidase activity. In cavalier King Charles spaniels, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been found. \u2022 Acquired xanthinuria is a complication of allopurinol therapy. High-purine diets increase the risk of xanthinuria in these patients. \u2022 Xanthine is the least soluble purine excreted in urine. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dog and cat. Naturally occurring xanthinuria is more common in cats. \u2022 Naturally occurring xanthinuria and xanthine uroliths have occurred in young cavalier King Charles spaniels. \u2022 Cats\u2014adult males (66%) and females (33%) (mean age 3.3 years; range 2 months\u2013 13 years).

The phenotypic spectrum is wide, with some dogs having infrequent single premature ventricular complexes while others have frequent and rapid ventricular tachycardia (VT) that is associated with sudden death. The pattern of inheritance is complex, depending heavily on background genetics. Siblings of dogs that have died suddenly should be tested for this disorder. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Most dogs develop arrhythmias at approx - imately 12 weeks of age (identified as young as 6 weeks). Number and severity of arrhythmias tend to peak between 5\u20139 months.

RISK FACTORS Any severe systemic illness or cardiac disease.", "Ventricular Pre-Excitation and Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White Syndrome": " \u2022 Ventricular pre-excitation occurs when impulses originating in the sinoatrial node or atrium activate a portion of the ventricles prematurely through an accessory pathway without going through the atrioventricular (AV) node; the remainder of the ventricles are activated normally through the usual conduction system. \u2022 Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) syndrome consists of ventricular pre-excitation with episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Figures 1 and 2). ECG Features of Ventricular Pre-excitation \u2022 Normal heart rate and rhythm. \u2022 Normal P waves. \u2022 Short PR interval (dogs, <0.06 seconds; cats, <0.05 seconds). \u2022 Widened QRS (small dogs, >0.05 seconds; large dogs, >0.06 seconds; cats, >0.04 seconds), often with slurring or notching of the upstroke of the R wave (delta wave). ECG Features of Ventricular Preexcitation with WPW Syndrome \u2022 Extremely rapid heart rate (dogs, often >300 bpm; cats, approaching 400\u2013500 bpm). \u2022 P waves may be difficult to recognize. \u2022 QRS complexes may be normal, wide with delta wave, or very wide and bizarre, depending on the circuit. \u2022 Conduction is usually 1:1 (i.e., 1 P wave for every QRS complex). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Can be associated with congenital or acquired cardiac defects in dogs or cats. \u2022 May be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cats. \u2022 Hemodynamic compromise during episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with WPW syndrome. \u2022 WPW syndrome results from a developmental abnormality of the atrioventricular groove. During normal cardiogenesis, direct continuity between the atrial and ventricular myocardium is lost by growth of the annulus fibrosis. Defects in the annulus leave muscular connections called accessory pathways or Kent bundles between the atria and ventricular myocardium. By bypassing the AV node, these pathways can lead to pre-excitation of the ventricles. \u2022 The accessory pathways typically have an \u201call or none\u201d conduction properties. They may only conduct from the atria to the ventricles (called anterograde or antegrade conduction), only from the ventricles to the atria (called retrograde conduction), or in both directions.

Numerous classification schemes have been proposed; briefly, the defect may be in the outlet, muscular, or membranous septum. Most ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in small animals are perimembranous, such that the defect is subaortic and has a right ventricular orifice that is beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 A VSD results in an interventricular communication\u2014direction and volume of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect, the relationship of the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, and the presence of other anomalies. \u2022 Most VSDs in dogs and cats are small and therefore restrictive (i.e., sufficiently small that the difference between left and right ventricular pressures is maintained). Moderate-sized VSDs are only partially restrictive and result in various degrees of right ventricular hypertension. Large VSDs have an area that is as large as or larger than the open aortic valve; they are nonrestrictive, so that left and right ventricular pressures are necessarily equal. Only moderate and large defects impose a pressure load upon the right ventricle (Figure 1). \u2022 In a patient with normal resistance to right ventricular ejection, the direction of the shunt is left-to-right, which increases pulmonary venous return and imposes a volume load on the left atrium and ventricle. With large shunts, congestive failure can develop. \u2022 Unless the defect is of moderate or large size, the right ventricle is spared. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Respiratory\u2014if pulmonary edema develops. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014a large shunt can result in pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and shunt reversal (i.e., Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome). This is uncommon in small animals; if shunt reversal occurs, it seems to do so early in life. GENETICS Breed predispositions recognized; genetic transmission has not been established.

A diastolic decrescendo murmur may result if the VSD undermines anatomic support of the aortic valve, causing aortic regurgitation. Patients with right-to-left shunts generally do not have murmurs. \u2022 Split second heart sound in some patients. \u2022 Femoral pulses usually normal. \u2022 Mucous membranes\u2014pink, unless pulmonary vascular disease causes a right-toleft shunt and arterial hypoxemia. \u2022 Tachycardia, dyspnea, and crackles may be evident if left ventricular failure occurs. CAUSES Congenital; may have a genetic basis.", "Ventricular Standstill (Asystole)": " Absence of ventricular complexes on the ECG or absence of ventricular activity (electrical\u2013 mechanical dissociation).

To date, no available medical therapy is known to prevent sudden death (SD) in animals afflicted with VT. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Severity of VT depends both on the hemodynamic consequences (hypotension) and on the electrical instability of a rhythm, i.e. its potential to degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF), resulting in SD. In Dobermans, SD due to VT\u2013VF occurs in about 30\u201350% of cases. In boxers with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), 33% are syncopal due to VT and 30% have SD due VT\u2013VF. Similarly, 13% of English bulldogs with inherited ARVC experience SD. Underlying mechanisms of VT include increased auto maticity, reentry, and triggered activity. ECG Features (Figure 1) \u2022 QRS complexes\u2014typically wide and bizarre. \u2022 Three or more ventricular premature contractions in a row. \u2022 May be intermittent (paroxysmal) or sustained; heart rate usually >150 bpm with a regular or irregular rhythm. \u2022 P waves, if visible, are dissociated from the QRS complexes. \u2022 Breed\u00adspecific ECG changes\u2014VT in boxers is characteristically positive in the ventrocaudal leads (leads II, III, and aVF), thus manifests a \u201cleft bundle branch block pattern.\u201d VT in Doberman pinschers and German shepherd dogs has both polymorphic and monomorphic characteristics. SYSTEMS AFFECTED Cardiovascular system, with secondary effects on other systems due to poor perfusion. GENETICS \u2022 In boxers, ARVC is inherited as autosomal dominant trait with adult onset of disease. Some boxers have a mutation in the striatin gene, but the disease is manifested with incomplete penetrance (i.e., even if a boxer has the genetic mutation, it may not lead to the development of arrhythmias in that dog) and it is likely that there is more than one mutation in boxers that may lead to the disease in some lines. Striatin is a desmosomal protein (scaffolding protein) located in the intercalated disc region of the cardiomyocyte and colocalizes with desmosomal proteins such as plakophilin\u00ad2 and other known proteins that are mutated in human ARVC. DNA test results can indicate if a dog is heterozygous or homozygous for the genetic striatin deletion. Homozygous dogs are more likely to show disease and should not be used for breeding. \u2022 English bulldogs also appear to harbor a form of inherited ARVC manifest with VT and SD in 13% of dogs. Genetic mode of inheritance is undetermined. There is 2.9:1 male to female ratio of affectedness. Unlike boxers with ARVC, the majority of English bulldogs appear to present with signs of CHF at the time of arrhythmia detection. \u2022 Dilated cardiomyopathy with VT in Doberman pinschers is inherited as an auto \u00ad somal dominant trait with adult onset of disease. In Dobermans there are two genetic mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and VT identified in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene ( PDK4/NCSU/DCM1 ) and the titin gene ( NCSU DCM2 ). Dogs with both mutations are at the highest risk of getting DCM, although dogs with a mutation in either gene can develop the disease as well. \u2022 Inherited VT and SD, considered primarily an \u201celectrical disorder\u201d (since no underlying structural heart disease is identified), is found in young German shepherd dogs and English springer spaniels. They have been shown to have inherited channelopathies, resulting in repolarization abnormalities. In springer spaniels a mutation in the KCNQ1 gene, responsible for a repolarizing K channel, was found to exhibit QT interval prolongation on ECG and SD. In German shepherd dogs, the mode of inheritance is polygenic due to an abnormality in a major gene with modifiers. \u2022 Young Rhodesian ridgebacks have been found to be affected with severe ventricular arrhythmias and SD. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode and linked to a genetic mutation, likely associated with mitochondrial alterations. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE Common in dogs; uncommon in cats. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION None SIGNALMENT Species Dog and cat. Breed Predilections Commonly seen in large\u00adbreed dogs with cardiomyopathy, especially boxers and Doberman pinschers, also in German shepherd dogs and Rhodesian ridgebacks. Mean Age and Range \u2022 All age groups, if not breed\u00adspecific VT. \u2022 Boxers with ARVC usually present at 4\u20136 years of age; frequency and severity of the arrhythmia usually increase over time. \u2022 Doberman pinschers with occult cardiomyopathy typically develop ventricular arrhythmias beginning at 3\u20136 years of age, but it also can occur much later in life; frequency and severity usually increase over time. \u2022 German shepherd dogs develop ventricular arrhythmias at 12\u201316 weeks of age and the frequency and severity of the arrhythmias increase until 24\u201330 weeks of age. After 8 months of age the arrhythmia severity stabilizes or starts to decrease. \u2022 The Rhodesian ridgeback\u2019s most severe arrhythmias are found between 6 and 30 months of age, after which many dogs appear to outgrow the problem. \u2022 Bulldogs with ARVC have a mean age of 9.2 years at time of presentation for arrhythmias. SIGNS Historical Findings \u2022 Syncope. \u2022 Weakness. \u2022 Exercise intolerance. \u2022 SD. \u2022 May be asymptomatic. Physical Examination Findings \u2022 May be normal if arrhythmia is paroxysmal and absent during examination. \u2022 Paroxysmal or sustained tachycardia may be ausculted. \u2022 Femoral pulses may have variable pulse intensity or be weak during runs of VT. \u2022 Signs of CHF or a murmur may be present, depending on cause of arrhythmia.

The VT occurring secondary to those circumstances may occur at heart rates similar to the sinus rate (in this scenario the rhythm is termed \u201caccelerated idioventricular rhythm\u201d rather than VT since the heart rate is normal), thus considered less malignant, and are often self\u00adlimiting with correction or resolution of the underlying cause.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 In the normal vertebral column, passive (bones, ligaments, discs), active (tendons, muscles), and neural systems are responsible for stability. \u2022 Compression, lateral bending, torsion, and sheer forces may result in failure of these systems, leading to vertebral fracture or subluxation. \u2022 In some instances, significant spinal cord injury (SCI) such as traumatic disc herniation, penetrating injuries and post\u00adtraumatic vascular myelopathy, can be present without instability or fracture. \u2022 SCI is the result of primary and secondary injuries. \u2022 Primary injury results from initial mechanical events (spinal cord compression, contusion). The secondary injury is the biochemical cascade (combination of oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular injury) that follows and causes extension of the primary injury. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Nervous. \u2022 Musculoskeletal. \u2022 Others possible due to exogenous trauma. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE \u2022 Vertebral fractures and luxations represented 6% of all feline myelopathies and 7% of all canine neurology cases in two studies. \u2022 The incidence of traumatic SCI without fracture/luxation is unknown.

SIGNS General Comments \u2022 The majority of dogs with vertebral column trauma have SCI. \u2022 Concurrent peripheral (e.g., brachial plexus trauma) or CNS injuries (e.g., head trauma) can occur. \u2022 Abnormalities associated with other body systems are frequently identified. Historical Findings \u2022 Acute\u00adonset paresis and ataxia or para\u00ad/ tetraplegia. \u2022 Clinical signs suggestive of hyperesthesia (vocalization, reluctance to move, arched back).

This condition is usually nonresponsive to symptomatic treatment. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Vomiting occurs when the vomiting center, located within the medulla oblongata, is activated by the humoral or neural pathway. \u2022 There are four main components to the vomiting reflex: (1) visceral receptors within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; (2) vagal and sympathetic afferent neurons; (3) chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ); and (4) vomiting center. \u2022 The humoral pathway is mediated via activation of the CRTZ and is affected by bloodborne triggers such as uremic toxins, drug toxicity, and endotoxemia. \u2022 The neural pathway is mediated via activation of the vomiting center and is affected by disorders associated with obstruction, distension, or inflammation of the GI tract. \u2022 All causes of vomiting (including the vestibular apparatus and cerebrum) are ultimately mediated via the vomiting center. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Endocrine/metabolic\u2014dehydration, electrolyte and acid\u00adbase imbalances. \u2022 Cardiovascular\u2014hypovolemia; electrolyte or acid\u2013base imbalances can cause arrhythmias. \u2022 GI\u2014esophagitis and subsequent esophageal stricture. \u2022 Respiratory\u2014aspiration pneumonia. \u2022 Nervous\u2014altered mentation.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 VWF is an adhesive plasma protein required for platelet binding at sites of small vessel injury. In addition, plasma VWF is a carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII. \u2022 A lack of VWF impairs platelet adhesion and aggregation, especially at vascular sites under high shear stress (e.g., arterial vessels). The largest molecular weight (MW) forms of VWF demonstrate highest reactivity in supporting platelet\u2013collagen interactions. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 VWF deficiency may cause spontaneous hemorrhage, prolonged post-traumatic hemorrhage, and ultimately blood-loss anemia. \u2022 Spontaneous hemorrhage\u2014typically manifests as bleeding from mucosal surfaces. GENETICS \u2022 An autosomal trait; both males and females express and transmit the defect with equal frequency. \u2022 Expression pattern of severe forms (types 2 and 3 von Willebrand disease [VWD]) is recessive; the milder form (type 1 VWD) appears to be recessive or incomplete dominant.

Type 1 is the most common classification: \u25e6 Breeds\u2014Airedale terrier, Akita, basset hound, Bernese mountain dog, dachshund, Doberman pinscher, German shepherd dog, golden retriever, greyhound, Irish wolfhound, Manchester terrier, miniature pinscher, Pembroke Welsh corgi, poodle, and sporadic cases in other purebred and mixed-breed dogs. \u2022 Type 2 VWD (severe signs)\u2014quantitative and functional protein defect; low VWF:Ag with profound lack of activity due to absence of high MW multimers: \u25e6 Breeds\u2014German wirehaired and shorthaired pointers. \u2022 Type 3 VWD (severe signs)\u2014complete lack of plasma VWF: \u25e6 Breeds\u2014Chesapeake Bay retriever, Dutch kooiker, Scottish terrier, Shetland sheepdog, and sporadic cases in dogs of other breeds. Mean Age and Range \u2022 Severe (types 2 and 3 VWD) typically manifests by 3\u20136 months of age. \u2022 Milder forms typically demonstrate abnormal bleeding after surgery or trauma, or in association with another condition that impairs hemostasis. SIGNS Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Hemorrhage from mucosal surfaces\u2014 epistaxis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, vaginal hemorrhage, gingival hemorrhage. \u2022 Prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. \u2022 Blood loss and/or iron-deficiency anemia, if prolonged hemorrhage. \u2022 Petechiae rarely present. CAUSES Hereditary VWD is caused by mutations that impair VWF synthesis, release, or stability. RISK FACTORS Acquired disease conditions or drug therapy that impair platelet function may exacerbate clinical signs of VWD.", "Weight Loss and Cachexia": " \u2022 Weight loss\u2014loss of body weight (BW) resulting from reduction in fat mass and/or lean body mass. \u2022 Lean body mass (LBM)\u2014tissues other than adipose tissue (muscle, organs, bone); skeletal muscle is most dynamic component. \u2022 Simple starvation\u2014acute or chronic decrease in food intake below caloric requirements in an otherwise healthy animal; adaptive responses allow loss of fat mass over LBM. \u2022 Cachexia\u2014weight loss and tissue wasting secondary to underlying disease (e.g., cancer, heart failure, inflammatory conditions). Hallmark is loss of LBM; fat mass is variably affected. \u2022 Sarcopenia\u2014age\u00adrelated muscle loss and decline in muscle quality. Can occur without loss of BW. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Weight Loss and Simple Starvation \u2022 Decreased caloric intake or increased energy expenditure results in negative energy balance. \u2022 In otherwise healthy animals, compensation such as reduced metabolism and a shift toward lipid\u00adbased energy production reduce protein catabolism by up to two\u00adthirds. Cachexia \u2022 Occurs secondary to acute or chronic disease (see Causes). \u2022 Pathophysiology better evaluated in humans than dogs and cats: \u25e6 Upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin\u00ad6 [IL\u00ad6], tumor necrosis factor\u00ad \u03b1 [TNF\u00ad \u03b1 ]), catecholamines, neuro \u00ad hormones and cortisol. \u25e6 Increases in oxidative stress; activation of catabolic pathways (e.g., ubiquitinproteasome system). \u25e6 Decreases in anabolic factors (e.g., growth hormone [GH], insulin\u00adlike growth factor I [IGF\u00ad1]). \u2022 Results in dysregulation of appetite, insulin resistance, increased muscle catabolism, and impaired tissue synthesis. \u2022 Increased basal metabolic rate and metabolic inefficiencies contribute to tissue wasting. \u2022 Secondary anorexia aggravates malnutrition and muscle catabolism. Sarcopenia \u2022 Occurs during normal aging in the absence of disease; may occur alongside cachexia. \u2022 Inflammation, oxidative stress, and catabolic pathway upregulation likely contribute to LBM loss similarly to cachexia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED \u2022 Musculoskeletal\u2014progressive loss of LBM causes weakness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. \u2022 Hemic/lymphatic/immune\u2014serous atrophy of fat can rarely cause bone marrow hypoplasia and pancytopenia. \u2022 Underlying diseases leading to cachexia can affect all body systems.

Predominant Sex None SIGNS General Comments \u2022 Body Condition Score (BCS)\u2014palpation/ observation of fat deposits over ribs, lumbar spine, abdominal fat pad (cats), and tail base: \u25e6 Scored 1 (severe fat loss) to 9 (obesity). \u2022 Muscle Condition Score (MCS)\u2014palpation/ visualization of muscle of spine, skull, scapulae, and wings of the ilia: \u25e6 Graded as none, mild, moderate, or severe muscle wasting. \u2022 BCS and MCS must be evaluated separately, as loss of LBM can occur without loss of fat or change in BW. Historical Findings \u2022 Appetite may be normal, increased, decreased, or absent depending on cause. \u2022 History should focus on identifying underlying disease (see Causes). Physical Examination Findings \u2022 Decreased BW compared to historical weights (corrected for hydration changes, fluid accumulation, etc.). \u2022 Decreased absolute or relative BCS (fat loss) and/or MCS (LBM loss). \u2022 Other physical examination findings may indicate underlying disease process (see Causes). CAUSES Physiologic Negative Energy Balance \u2022 Simple starvation. \u2022 Competition in a multi\u00adpet household. \u2022 Increased physical activity. \u2022 Prolonged or extreme cold environment. \u2022 Pregnancy or lactation.

RISK FACTORS \u2022 Age. \u2022 See Causes.", "West Nile Virus Infection": " \u2022 Acute to inapparent viral disease with neurologic manifestations caused by West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus . \u2022 Geographic distribution of virus is North, Central, South America, Africa, Asia, southern Europe, and Australia (Kunjin virus). \u2022 Natural route of infection is through bite of numerous species of mosquitoes depending upon geographic location. Infection produces a low-level viremia, insufficient for dogs to be an amplifying host; antibody detectable by day 7 post infection. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Natural infections not limited by species or age. \u2022 Seroprevalence varies widely with geographic region (3\u201396%). SIGNS \u2022 High percentage of dogs show no clinical signs\u2014no experimentally infected dogs have shown clinical signs. \u2022 Incubation period 2\u20134 days post infection. \u2022 Febrile response 104\u2013108\u00b0F (40.3\u201342.2\u00b0C) 3\u20136 days post infection. \u2022 In the rare affected dog, common signs are ataxia, depression, anorexia, tremors, conscious proprioceptive deficits, seizures, weakness, flaccid paralysis; polyarthritis and myocarditis also reported. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Neurologic disease caused by WNV. \u2022 Outdoor dogs much greater odds of being seropositive than indoor dogs; high seroprevalence in coyotes. \u2022 Stray dogs at greater odds of being seropositive than owned dogs. \u2022 Lineage 1 virus more neurovirulent (all North American isolates) than lineage 2 (Africa). \u2022 Yearly fluctuation of infections linked to density of mosquito populations.", "Whipworms (Trichuriasis)": " \u2022 The whipworm, Trichuris , infects the cecum of dogs ( T. vulpis ) and cats ( T. campanula and T. serrata ); feline trichuriasis is extremely rare in continental United States. \u2022 Life cycle is direct; infection is acquired by ingestion of larvated eggs; infective eggs can persist in environment for months to years. \u2022 Infection can be asymptomatic or cause bloody diarrhea and large bowel inflammation. \u2022 Clinical signs can occur before patency, i.e., before eggs are shed in feces; prepatent period is approximately 70\u201390 days. \u2022 No extraintestinal migration occurs. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs and cats. \u2022 No age, breed, or sex predilections. SIGNS \u2022 Range from asymptomatic to severe. \u2022 Intermittent large bowel diarrhea often containing mucus and fresh blood (hematochezia). \u2022 Bloody diarrhea with dehydration, anemia, and weight loss in severe cases. \u2022 Signs can occur before eggs detectable in feces. \u2022 Acute to chronic debilitation. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Ingestion of infective (larvated) eggs from fecally contaminated environment. \u2022 Eggs accumulate in environment and remain infective for months to years, especially in soil in moist, shady areas. \u2022 Return of dog to an environment contaminated with infective eggs after anthelmintic treatment will result in reinfection.", "Xylitol Toxicosis": " \u2022 Xylitol\u2014a 5-carbon sugar alcohol used most commonly as a sweetener; present in many sugar-free gums, candies, toothpastes, mouthwashes, chewable over-the-counter medications and supplements, nasal sprays, liquid medications, specialty foods, and baked goods. It is also available as a granulated powder for cooking and baking. \u2022 Ingestion by dogs can cause vomiting, weakness, ataxia, seizures, hypokalemia, and hypoglycemia due to excess insulin release. \u2022 Mild to moderate elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) can be seen within 4 hours of ingestion. \u2022 Dosages >0.1 g/kg may cause hypo- glycemia. \u2022 Hepatic failure may occur at dosages >0.5 g/kg, with secondary coagulopathy possible due to hepatic necrosis. SIGNALMENT \u2022 Dogs\u2014no breed, age, or sex predilection. \u2022 Cats\u2014toxicity not expected. SIGNS \u2022 Vomiting may develop within 15\u201330 minutes of exposure. \u2022 Hypoglycemia may develop in as little as 2 hours after ingestion, with signs including progressive lethargy, weakness, ataxia, collapse, and seizures. \u2022 Hepatic failure with signs of icterus as well as possible hemorrhage including petechiae, ecchymosis, and gastrointestinal and abdominal bleeding may be seen within 24\u201348 hours after ingestion. \u2022 Hypoglycemia may not occur prior to onset of hepatic failure. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS Ingestion of xylitol or xylitol-containing products.", "Zinc Toxicosis": " \u2022 Toxicity results from the ingestion of zinc-containing material. \u2022 Many zinc compounds: zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (dietary supplements), zinc chloride (deodorants), zinc pyrithione (shampoos), zinc acetate (throat lozenges), zinc oxide (sunblock, Desitin, calamine lotion), zinc sulfide (paints), metallic zinc (coins). \u2022 Causes gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and intravascular hemolytic anemia; may cause multiple organ failure (e.g., renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and cardiac), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and cardiopulmonary arrest. SIGNALMENT Most frequently reported in small-breed dogs less than 30 pounds (small pylorus retains zinc object or dose response); can occur in all species, all sizes. SIGNS \u2022 Onset of signs varies depending on the form of zinc, stomach acidity, and nutritional status of the patient. \u2022 Initial signs due to the irritant nature of the zinc chloride salts on the GI mucosa, causing vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and lethargy. \u2022 Later signs associated with intravascular hemolysis and potential pancreatic, hepatic and renal damage; may include continued vomiting/diarrhea/anorexia, pale or icteric mucous membranes, dehydration, tachypnea, pigmenturia, abdominal discomfort, orange-tinged feces, melena. CAUSES & RISK FACTORS \u2022 Toxic doses not well defined; unreferenced median lethal oral dose of \u201czinc salts\u201d is 100 mg/kg. \u2022 Toxicities result from ingestion of zinc-containing material: US pennies minted after 1982 (most common source), hardware (e.g., nuts, bolts), staples, galvanized metal (e.g., nails), boardgame pieces, zippers, toys, jewelry, holiday garland, bra clasps and hooks, animal identification tags, fixtures, buttons. \u2022 Brass\u2014alloy of copper and zinc. \u2022 Organic forms of zinc (e.g., zinc oxide) generally cause GI inflammation and self-limiting vomiting. \u2022 Stomach acidity promotes rapid leaching of zinc from the ingested substance, allowing zinc to be absorbed."};
